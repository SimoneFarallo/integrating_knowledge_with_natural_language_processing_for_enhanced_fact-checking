**INTEGRATING KNOWLEDGE WITH NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING FOR ENHANCED FACT-CHECKING**

In the digital age, where the proliferation of information intersects with the rise of sophisticated digital platforms, the challenge of distinguishing between fact and fiction has become a pivotal concern. This thesis addresses the critical issue of misinformation and disinformation through the development and evaluation of advanced automated fact-checking systems \citep{NLPFactCheck}. 
Leveraging state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing techniques, Large Language Models, and Graph-based analytics, this research introduces novel methodologies aimed at enhancing the accuracy, reliability, and explainability of fact-checking mechanisms.
Central to this work is the comparative analysis of embedding-based and graph-based approaches to automated fact-checking, exploring their respective strengths and limitations in addressing the complexity of verifying digital content.
Navigating the intricacies of evaluating digital content, the study uncovers that methods based on embeddings shine in grasping subtle semantic layers within various statements. Meanwhile, graph-centric strategies provide a clear, structured system for assessing claims with reference to well-defined knowledge collections. By synthesizing these methodologies, the thesis advances a hybrid fact-checking model that combines the depth of semantic analysis with the precision of graph-based verification, aiming to improve the overall efficacy of fact-checking systems.
Furthermore, this thesis places a strong emphasis on the principle of explainability within automated fact-checking processes. Recognizing the importance of transparency and accountability, it proposes mechanisms that not only determine the veracity of claims but also elucidate the rationale behind verification decisions. This dual focus on performance and explainability seeks to foster trust in automated fact-checking systems among users and stakeholders, contributing to the broader goal of combating misinformation in the digital landscape.

Through empirical evaluation across a range of original and generated claims, the study demonstrates the adaptability and precision of the proposed hybrid model, showcasing its capability to navigate the intricate challenges posed by the digital information ecosystem. The results highlight not only the technological advancements achieved but also the critical need for ongoing innovation in the fight against misinformation. 
This thesis contributes to the field of automated fact-checking by developing a framework that combines computational techniques with a focus on AI practices. It establishes a basis for further research to enhance the precision, efficiency, and clarity of automated fact-checking systems, signifying a notable development in pursuing accuracy in the digital era.
