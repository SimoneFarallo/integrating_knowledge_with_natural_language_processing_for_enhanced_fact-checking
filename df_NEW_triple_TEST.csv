16,16,9271,Treating at the Earliest Sign of MS May Offer Long-Term Benefit,"This release summarizes a study that followed 11-year treatment outcomes of two groups of patients with early symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS). All of the patients had experienced a first episode suggestive of MS, called clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), and a  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan suggesting MS. Up to 85 percent of people with CIS go on to develop MS. The two patient groups were randomized to either receive interferon beta-1 by injection immediately or receive a placebo for two years. After two years, the placebo group could receive their treatment of choice. The patients who received the drug immediately appeared to have fewer relapses over the 11 years of study, according to the lead author, but no advantages were observed in other patient outcomes such as overall disability and MRI scans. The release would have been stronger if it provided more context for judging the reduced number of relapses, especially in light of the two groups showing no difference in disability. The release also omitted mention of significant potential conflicts of interest, the high annual cost of interferon beta-1 and the drug’s side effects. Society faces tough questions because of the high prices of drugs that target the immune system, such as interferon beta-1b for multiple sclerosis. This news release suggests drug therapy should begin sooner for patients without including any of the controversy on cost playing out in the United States and Europe. Last year authors of a different research study, also published in Neurology, called the rise in MS drug prices “alarming” and wrote it was also puzzling, since some of the drugs are not new. “Why the costs of MS DMTs [disease modifying therapies] in the United States have risen so dramatically is uncertain. However, the simplest explanation is that pharmaceutical companies raise prices of new and old MS DMTs in the United States to increase profits and our health care system puts no limits on these increases,’ they wrote. Why is cost so important to mention? This drug study, in particular, has significant potential conflicts of interest, discussed below under the Funding Sources & Conflict of Interest Disclosure criteria.",mixture,"""Long-term benefits may be achieved by treating MS at its earliest sign.""","Starting treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS) at the earliest sign, such as clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), with interferon beta-1 injection may lead to fewer relapses over an 11-year period, as shown in a study comparing immediate treatment versus delayed treatment with a placebo.

25,25,9960,Scientists look to stem cell to mend broken heart,"It’s hard to know how a charity hoping to raise money for stem cell research could have achieved a better marketing coup than landing this story on the Reuters wire. Millions of readers worldwide were guaranteed to have seen the charity’s slogan about how stem cells can “mend broken hearts” right in the headline and lead of the story. Even the campaign’s mascot — the zebrafish — makes an appearance. What they did not see was any challenge to the extravagant claims made about cardiac cell regeneration, any discussion of the undoubtedly sky-high costs that would be associated with stem cell treatments, or any analysis by independent experts of the quality of the evidence supporting this line of research. Just about 1 in every 50 Americans has heart failure with about 400,000 diagnosed every year. The prevalence increases with age and the number of people with it will rise as a result of increased life expectancy. Heart failure symptoms can be managed with drugs and, in extreme cases, dysfunction can be helped with implantable assistive devices. But there is no cure. So, the announcement by the British Heart Foundation to raise and spend $80 million on research into cardiac cell regeneration is important and newsworthy. Stem cell therapy, gene therapy, nanotechnology and numerous other futuristic sounding medical treatments are beloved by researchers and health writers alike, and there are promising lines of inquiry to be pursued. The trouble comes when writers attempt to translate the very difficult, complicated and sometimes frustrating scientific process for a general readership.

The crux of this fact-check really comes down to how you define ""a lot."" While the record shows that the need for environmental impact statements and legal challenges have a significant impact on Forest Service projects on federal lands, the connection to the extreme fires of the past 15 years is less certain. Where we found broad consensus is that decades of aggressively putting out every fire as quickly as possible, and the use of land for grazing, created circumstances where the forests are brimming with fuel. That in conjunction with extended dry periods have turned them into tinderboxes. The federal strategy to remove that fuel runs up against budget constraints. The limited money is a much greater constraint than environmental policies. In the end, experts acknowledge that environmental policies are an issue, but they generally tip the scale toward other factors when assigning blame.

It contains lots of numbers, which we applaud. These numbers are important because they add to the limited database available to help guide treatment for athletes who have suffered a shoulder dislocation. As one study put it in 2014, “there is no consensus on the optimal treatment of in-season athletes with anterior shoulder instability, and limited data are available to guide return to play.” But, in stating a causal relationship, the news release goes beyond what the data support. Specifically, the news release says that the study “demonstrated that surgery after a first-time shoulder dislocation lowered the re-injury risks and need for follow-up surgery when compared to those who were initially treated non-operatively and experienced a repeat dislocation prior to surgery.” The study, which was observational in nature, can only show associations between shoulder surgery and subsequent outcomes — not that surgery after a first-time dislocation was the cause of reduced risks. Also missing from the release: harms, alternative therapies, costs and study limitations. This matters because, in the 2014 prospective study, just 27% of athletes whose shoulders were made unstable due to injury “returned to play and completed the season without subsequent instability.” According to the study abstract, the shoulder is the most common joint dislocation, affecting 2% of the general population, most of them males. And there’s a 50% likelihood of another dislocation after a first one, according to the background into given by the study authors. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention, there were some 63 million visits to non-federally employed, office-based physicians specializing in orthopedic surgery in the United States in 2010.

46,46,11042,Strobe lighting provides a flicker of hope in the fight against Alzheimer ’ s,"This story describes a study in which genetically engineered mice were exposed to an hour of pulsing light daily for a week, with the result that certain toxins associated with Alzheimer’s disease were dramatically reduced in their brains. The story suggests the flickering lights are an intriguing, non-invasive, and probably inexpensive idea that could hold promise for treatment of Alzheimer’s disease in humans. There is a major disclaimer: “The authors caution that a ‘big if’ remains over whether the findings would be replicated in humans – and whether cognitive deficits as well as visible symptoms of the disease would be improved.” This is a story that admits many of the limitations of the research it cites, but initially draws people in with a headline that promises much more than the research has so far delivered. The study cited was published in a top journal and could represent a meaningful step on the way toward innovative treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. The operative word, however, is “could.” This research is years away from impacting human lives, if indeed the findings end up being relevant to humans at all–and that needed to be explained better. Furthermore, the heavy use of medical terminology and a confusing explanation of the rationale behind the study could make it hard for many people to pick up on just how far from application the findings really are. This is a study that is important for researchers, but one we think probably didn’t need a wide general audience in mainstream news publications. Alzheimer’s is a tragic disease that impacts hundreds of millions of people worldwide. It is excruciating not only for victims but for caregivers who watch their loved ones incrementally being taken away from them. Hopeful headlines about results of mouse trials–the vast majority of which don’t translate into benefits to humans anyway–seem irresponsible.

53,53,9886,Experimental Drug Raises Good Cholesterol Levels in Early Trial,"Beginning with the lead and continuing throughout, the story reminded readers of the limitations of this trial and that questions about health benefits will have to wait for the next round of experimentation. However, although this story gives readers a balanced view of what researchers reported, it should have told them that the trial was sponsored by a drug company and that the lead researcher has financial ties to that company and others in the field. When a trial is designed to test safety, stories about the results should focus on that question without wandering off into speculation about health benefits that have yet to be put to the test. That’s what this story does. Over 20 million Americans currently take statin drugs. Anacetrapib works on cholesterol in a different way, by inhibiting a protein called CETP (cholesterol ester transfer protein). These drugs also offer hope to drug companies that are losing patent protection on the leading brands of statins. That marketing angle means journalists need to be vigilant about claims of benefits. The early tests of an earlier CETP inhibitor, torcetrapib, also indicated powerful effects on cholesterol, especially in raising levels of the “good” HDL form. However, as this story notes, larger trials then discovered dangerous side effects. It turned out that drug actually caused more heart problems than it prevented. In reality it takes a lot of subjects to even begin to get a picture of the risks and benefits of a new drug. While encouraging, the results of this study are far from conclusive.",true,"""An experimental drug has shown to increase good cholesterol levels in its initial trial phase.""","The trial for the experimental drug that raises good cholesterol levels is still in its early stages, and it is important to note that the lead researcher has financial ties to the sponsoring drug company.

61,61,9255,FDA Approves Bayer 's Kyleena™ ( Levonorgestrel-Releasing Intrauterine System ) 19.5 mg for Prevention of Pregnancy for up to Five Years,"The news release focuses on a forthcoming birth control product called Kyleena. The product is implanted in the uterus and releases the hormone levonorgestrel, which the release says can prevent pregnancy for up to five years. The release does a fair job of describing the clinical trial that led to FDA’s approval of Kyleena, and also addresses potential side effects associated with the product. However, the release does not address cost at all. The release also fails to discuss similar alternatives that are already on the market, or even offer any information comparing the effectiveness of Kyleena relative to other forms of birth control. [Editor’s note: Bayer makes a number of IUD contraceptive devices including Mirena and a permanent contraceptive called Essure. This release stacks up favorably to a Bayer news release on Essure which we also reviewed (and discussed in a blog post) in terms of discussing harms, quantified benefits and quality of evidence. However, neither release addressed costs.] According to the CDC, more than 7 percent of U.S. women use long-term, reversible contraceptives — i.e., intrauterine systems or implants — to avoid unwanted pregnancy. The widespread use of these technologies means that they are both economically important and — more importantly — that such birth control systems have a significant impact on the health and well-being of millions of women. As such, it is newsworthy when new products receive FDA approval and come to market. But in order for potential users — and their healthcare providers — to make sense of a new product, they need some basic information. For example, they need to know how the new product compares to existing products on the market — and how much they will cost.

Its main take-home message is “it takes about 60 to 75 minutes of ‘moderate intensity’ exercise to undo the damage of sitting for at least eight hours a day.” Although that’s a faithful account of how the study researchers frame their results, we think it’s likely to leave readers with a misleading impression.

There are many factors, other than exercise and sedentary behavior, that affect one’s risk of death (e.g. diet, illnesses, socioeconomic factors), and the story didn’t explain that researchers can’t account for all of those factors in a study like this. Suggesting that exercise “reverses” the damage of sitting implies a certainty to the study’s conclusions that simply doesn’t exist. Every day, readers are bombarded with health news messages from observational studies such as this one relating to diet, exercise, and other lifestyle issues.

75,75,8958,Weight loss can be boosted fivefold thanks to novel mental imagery technique,"The news release focuses on a study reporting that overweight individuals who engaged in functional imagery training (FIT) were more successful at losing weight than individuals who engaged in a type of talk therapy called motivational interviewing (MI). However, the release does not answer many questions that are relevant to determining how useful FIT is for weight loss. For example, because the study does not appear to have collected information on diet or exercise, it’s not clear whether the difference in outcomes stems from differences in lifestyle choices made by study participants. It would have been helpful if the release (and study) had analyzed specifically how increased motivation and lifestyle choices can result in weight loss. The published study notes that data relating to “participants’ experiences and process variables, including frequency of motivational cognitions, self-efficacy for diet and physical activity, self-reported diet and physical activity” were collected but that the results would be reported separately. When comparing the efficacy of MI and FIT, it’s important to know what sort of lifestyle changes study participants made. If a significant percentage of participants who engaged in FIT also joined a for-profit diet program, that support system might explain the differing results. By the same token, it’s not clear if the MI group and the FIT group were matched for initial weight, sex or age — any of which could influence how much weight was lost. Without knowledge of those details, it is difficult or impossible to say how much more effective FIT was than MI (if at all). According to the published research, there were some differences in full-time employment and the range in baseline weight that weren’t addressed in the limitations section of the study and which could affect the reliability of the data.",mixture,"""The use of a novel mental imagery technique can enhance weight loss by five times.""","The study highlighted in the news release suggests that overweight individuals who used functional imagery training (FIT) achieved greater weight loss compared to those who underwent motivational interviewing (MI).

It would have been beneficial to analyze how increased motivation and lifestyle choices contribute to weight loss. Data on participants' experiences, motivation levels, and lifestyle changes were collected but not included in the study. Understanding the specific lifestyle changes made by participants is crucial when comparing the effectiveness of FIT and MI.

117,117,11399,Blood Test May Predict Rheumatoid Arthritis,"There has been recognition that RA results in gradual, cumulative destruction of joints and other parts of the body. Since we now have powerful treatment options, there has been a push to begin using them earlier. However, it’s harder to identify RA in its early stages, when diagnostic techniques such as RF testing aren’t as helpful. Therefore, there is a need for new diagnostic techniques for the identification of patients with joint problems in the early stages of RA. That’s the context, and the social problem, described in the article. The study in question, however, is a little different. It’s about understanding the processes that lead to RA and techniques that may, in the future, lead to a test for patients who may develop RA in the future. There is no available evidence that treatment can stave off RA in patients who don’t have symptoms yet. We would have liked to have seen the article use additional sources besides the press release. Where it does not rely on the press release, it seems to stray too far. The article claims that the investigators ""say the finding paves the way for developing a blood test for early diagnosis of the mysterious disease."" We don’t believe they said that, neither in the published study nor even the press release. The authors say the technique could help identify people at risk for developing RA in the future — people who are not yet patients — as opposed to patients who have an early stage of the disease.

After the headline, the story really never improved.",false,"""A blood test could potentially predict the occurrence of Rheumatoid Arthritis.""","The study aims to understand the processes leading to Rheumatoid Arthritis and explore potential techniques for a future test to identify individuals at risk of developing the disease, rather than focusing on early diagnosis for patients in the early stages of RA.","[{'subject': 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'predicate': 'has cause', 'object': 'blood test'}, {'subject': 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'predicate': 'drug used for treatment', 'object': 'blood test'}, {'subject': 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'predicate': 'has cause', 'object': 'Blood test'}]","[{'subject': 'blood test', 'predicate': 'occurrence of', 'object': 'Arthritis'}, {'subject': 'blood test', 'predicate': 'occurrence of', 'object': 'Rheumatoid Arthritis'}]","[{'subject': 'test', 'predicate': 'predict of', 'object': 'occurrence'}]"
118,118,9673,'Female Viagra ' get mixed review,"This story reports the results of a review of the new drug for female sexual dysfunction, flibanserin (Addyi). This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis studying the impact of flibanserin in women with HSDD. The CNN coverage of this large and exhaustive study had many shortcomings starting with the headline. It is hardly a ‘mixed’ review when you compare a weighty study that found very marginal effects of the drug in nearly 6,000 women, and put that up against a single compelling anecdote of a women who says her life was turned around by the drug. It’s also questionable to give so much weight to the comments of a clinician with known ties to pharmaceutical companies that make drugs for female sexual problems (and without disclosing those relationships). This is an important piece of reporting because how a new drug performs in clinical studies on thousands of patients has a direct relevance to the women who would be encouraged to take the drug and the physicians who would want to prescribe it. Journalists need to be ultra cautious in reporting on such a ‘sexy’ topic and carefully weigh the comments of clinicians and patients who provide what seem to be ‘market-tested’ testimonials. Almost everything about the marketing and medicalization of female sexual dysfunction is controversial: the article acknowledges that controversy, but barely. Most thoughtful clinicians in this area see the problem as a multifactorial one, which may be affected by physiological changes, psychological issues, relationship factors, and/or cultural context.

128,128,10748,"Humira Provides Effective , Non-Steroid Alternative for Eye Inflammation","A study of 217 people afflicted with an eye disease called uveitis tried to determine just how well adalimumab, a pricy “biologic” drug, could stave off frustrating symptoms like inflammation inside the eye, floaters, cloudy vision, and blurred vision. Every patient received standard daily injections of a corticostroid called prednisone, but half were also given a placebo injection, and half were given injections of adalimumab, which is FDA-approved to treat other diseases. Adalimumab held uveitis at bay for 24 weeks, or nearly twice as long as the control group at 13 weeks. But that extra uveitis symptom control came with two costs: a significant uptick in “severe adverse events” and a treatment that costs 50 times more than the one it supplemented. The study published in the NEJM was one of two that supported FDA approval of the drug for uveitis. As this news release clearly points out, the study was sponsored by the company that sells the drug and many of the authors served as paid consultants to the company. The Duke Medicine-issued release about the study also grasped the benefits and quality of the evidence very well. Uveitis, or inflammation of and damage to important structures in the eye, is a relatively rare disease that affects about 43,000 new people a year in the United States, according to the Ocular Immunology and Uveitis Foundation. While treatable, left untreated it was once a leading cause of blindness worldwide. Most people are treated with daily injections of a corticosteroid called prednisone. However, steroids like prednisone, used long-term or sometimes only briefly, can lead to diabetes, osteoporosis, and even psychological changes, since they not only only dial back inflammation, but also affect the body’s metabolism. So any drug that can more specifically target the inflammation seen in the eyes of uveitis patients could cut back these risks and improve treatment efficacy. Adalimumab (marketed as Humira) is approved for several other immune system diseases including psoriasis, arthritis and Crohn’s disease. Although adalimumabit is not a cure for those diseases or for uveitis, it is an alternative to steroids. That said, the drug comes with side effects, many of which have to do with its action in suppressing the immune system which increases the risk of infections and cancer.",true,"""Humira is a non-steroid alternative used for the treatment of eye inflammation.""","The study showed that Humira, also known as adalimumab, effectively controlled uveitis symptoms for 24 weeks, compared to 13 weeks with the control group.

132,132,8970,Blood test may identify gestational diabetes risk in first trimester,"This release accurately describes an observational study using second-hand data from another study  which found that a relatively inexpensive blood test (HbA1c or A1C for short), commonly used to monitor diabetes, might help identify women at risk for getting gestational diabetes as early as the 10th week of pregnancy. The release does a good job of explaining that the disorder carries risks — including the development of adult type 2 diabetes long after birth — for both pregnant women and their newborns. The release notes that the study does not scientifically demonstrate that measuring HbA1c levels in early pregnancy can in fact determine a woman’s later risk for gestational diabetes. On the down side, the release doesn’t mention what it would cost in dollars or potential over treatment to screen every women in the early weeks of pregnancy;  offers no information about the overall prevalence and incidence of gestational diabetes or any details about the women whose records were studied; and waits until the last sentence to note that there also is no firm evidence that lowering HbA1c levels with diet and exercise before or in early pregnancy will actually reduce risk for gestational diabetes. Public health and obstetrical associations estimate that 1 to 15% of all pregnant women in the U.S. develop gestational diabetes and no doubt a greater percentage worries they might. There are potentially serious health consequences to gestational diabetes for mother and child and although some mothers at higher than usual risk — for example, women with obesity — are screened early, most women have a screening blood glucose test later in pregnancy. Glucose and insulin levels are complicated to interpret later in pregnancy.

135,135,11438,Glaxo Touts Experimental Tykerb As Effective Breast-Cancer Treament,"The story discusses the preliminary results of lapatinib (trade name Tykerb) and chemotherapy in HER-2 positive metastatic breast cancer patients. Patients who took lapatinib and the chemotherapy drug Xeloda remained stable (i.e. cancer did not spread further) nearly twice as long as patients who only had chemotherapy (8.5 months vs. 4.5 months). However, many drugs are effective in prolonging response in metastatic disease without impacting length of life. It would be good to get survival data to back up these claims, or at least provide data on quality of life to see whether the addition of lapatinib made a difference and how much. Additionally, the results of this trial have not been scrutinized in a peer-reviewed medical journal. The story provides a powerful, but premature suggestion of equivalence between Herceptin and lapatinib. The suggeston is not evidenced based, as the two drugs have not been compared in a controlled trial. Potential cardiac side effects are a big issue for early-stage breast cancer patients, the group of women for whom this drug is already being tested as an alternative to Herceptin, so further research comparing the two drugs is needed. This story relies solely on sources associated with the drug manufacturer. It also appears to rely heavily on information from a press release by the study sponsor, GlaxoSmithKline. Other oncology researchers are needed for perspective on the results of lapatinib as part of treatment for HER-2 positive cancer. The story mentions that lapatinib is still being tested in clinical trials and is not yet available for sale. The story says that “GlaxoSmithKline plans to submit the drug for regulatory approval in the U.S. and Europe by the end of this year,” and later mentions Glaxo’s “high hopes for Tykerb.” It would have been better to get some other perspectives about these prospects, other than comments from the company or company-sponsored researchers.",mixture,"""Tykerb, an experimental drug, is being promoted by Glaxo as an effective treatment for breast cancer.""","The preliminary results of lapatinib (Tykerb) in combination with chemotherapy for HER-2 positive metastatic breast cancer patients show that patients who received both drugs remained stable for a longer period compared to those who only received chemotherapy.

It is important to note that the comparison between lapatinib and Herceptin is not based on controlled trials, and potential cardiac side effects need to be further investigated, especially for early-stage breast cancer patients.

137,137,9691,New breast cancer screening guideline at odds with Congress,"The story provides a good overview of new recommendations from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) on when, and how often, women should receive mammograms to screen for breast cancer. The story summarizes the long-running debate over mammogram recommendations, particularly congressional action on the issue. The story also discusses the differing advice that various organizations provide on when women at average risk of breast cancer should begin mammogram screening, though the story would have been stronger if it had more fully explored both the benefits and potential harms associated with women starting mammogram screening early or having the tests more often (something that a competing New York Times story on the recommendations does well). The story also offers a good discussion of issues related to what the USPSTF recommendations may mean for insurance coverage of mammograms, though it does not tell readers how expensive mammograms may be without insurance. Breast cancer screening is a big deal. As the CDC notes, “Not counting some kinds of skin cancer, breast cancer in the United States is the most common cancer in women, no matter your race or ethnicity.” In 2012 alone, 41,150 women died of the disease. Breast cancer also has a profound impact on the economy, with researchers estimating that it costs the U.S. billions of dollars each year. In other words, it affects the health and well-being of millions of patients and their loved ones, as well as having an adverse impact on the economy. News that relates to the early detection and treatment of breast cancer is clearly news worth covering, particularly when it could inform the decision-making of women and health professionals — and have an effect on women’s access to screening.",true,"""The new guidelines for breast cancer screening are conflicting with Congress.""","The explanation provides an overview of the new breast cancer screening guidelines issued by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and the debate surrounding mammogram recommendations, including congressional involvement.

While indicating that it is too early to say whether XL184 actually affects the cancer, the story should have reminded readers of the importance of things like quality of life and survival time.

At issue is that, while advanced prostate cancer is a challenge, not all men with advanced prostate cancer would benefit from Provenge, though the story neglected this. And it is not clear that XL184 is of benefit to anyone. News about results from a small study that is still ongoing cannot carry enough caveats.

Although alternatives are nicely covered — benefits, costs, availability, and potential harms of the outpatient probe procedure are not. We also reviewed a HealthDay news story about the study. Both the story and news release would have been improved with more discussion about cost, benefits and harms. Chronic back pain that does not respond to conservative treatment, and sometimes includes shooting pain into the buttocks and leg (sciatica), is difficult to treat, a leading cause of disability, and poses a huge economic burden to both individuals and the health care system. Although the search for treatments that are “minimally invasive” are well-intentioned and much needed, this catchphrase can be quite misleading. As we’ve written before, many readers erroneously equate “minimally invasive” with more advanced and effective, and involving fewer complications and recovery time. Rather than prey on this notion, releases should clarify if procedures touted in this way even come close to meeting such expectations. Many back patients have very straightforward questions they need answered: Do I need surgery? If not, what are my alternatives? How effective are those alternatives? What are the benefits vs. risks involved? What will it cost me? Not answering those questions clearly (or making it clear if the answers are unknown) does readers a disservice. Back pain creates tremendous personal, family and economic burdens. In the majority of individuals, the source of the pain cannot be identified, and undoubtedly there are many different causes of back pain. If the source of pain in any individual can be identified accurately, specific interventions may be able to be developed to treat that subset of patients resulting in improved quality of life for those individuals and less economic burden. But it’s also important to keep in mind that in the vast majority of individuals, the pain resolves spontaneously without any residual disability.",false,"""Pulsed radiofrequency provides relief for acute back pain, which includes sciatica.""","The study on pulsed radiofrequency for relieving acute back pain and sciatica has limitations that are not adequately addressed in the news release.

170,170,10888,Study Shows Limited Benefits From Calcium,"This piece reports on the outcomes from the Women’s Health Initiative about the effectiveness of calcium and vitamin D to prevent hip fracture. Although the results showed that the level of calcium and vitamin D supplementation did not significantly reduce hip fracture, they did find that this level of supplementation did increase the risk of kidney stones. There were several interesting points raised in the study that were not reported on in this story. This first is that the methods used to encourage supplement use was only adequate to get a subset of the women studied to take the supplements. The results also point out the discrepancy between the common measure of ‘bone health’ (bone density) and the outcome of importance (fracture rate).

Any news release touching on Parkinson’s disease — or any other of the neurodegenerative disorders that have no cure — is likely to draw a lot of attention from news organizations. Parkinson’s disease alone affects about 1 million Americans and 10 million people worldwide. Although this news release clearly states the disease has no cure, it is riddled with language that implies fish consumption inhibits amyloid formation and that amyloid formation “can be responsible for various diseases,” but that’s an unproven theory and not even addressed by this study. Our concern is that this framing will be adopted by unskeptical reporters and the cause and effect language will be erroneously adopted despite absolutely no evidence to support it.",false,"""Consuming a higher quantity of fish may be a preventative measure against Parkinson's disease.""","The study conducted by Chalmers University of Technology suggests that the fish protein, parvalbumin, binds to a human protein called ""alpha-synuclein,"" which is known to form amyloid chains in Parkinson's disease patients.

Following a recently published study, Jardiance is now being positioned as an add-on to standard care and a preventative therapy that reduces the risk of cardiovascular death, as well as risk of death from any cause, in patients with type 2 diabetes. The story capably lays out the basics of the study, but its reliance on relative risk figures (which may tend to inflate the magnitude of the effect), as well as the lack of any comment on potential harms, were considered significant drawbacks by our reviewers. Editor’s note: We learned that Reuters made updates to the initial version of this story, including the headline, after our review was complete. Although we applaud such efforts to provide more information and context to readers, such efforts do miss readers like us who only saw the original version of the story. People with type 2 diabetes are two to four times more likely to develop cardiovascular disease than people without diabetes, according to the World Heart Association. Cardiovascular disease is also a leading cause of death among people with diabetes.

239,239,10201,Partial rather than full knee replacement better for many – report,"This story parrots a news release sent out by Oxford University about a study published in the journal BMJ Open. The study concludes that partial knee replacements would — in many cases — leave patients “better off” than total knee replacements. With no independent reporting, the story glosses over how the study was conducted, what was measured, and what the limitations were. It also didn’t discuss harms of surgery, among other problems. An over-reliance on publicity materials appears to be a pattern — last week the Guardian received a 1-star score from us for a different story that also simply restated what the news release said. Knee replacement surgeries are not uncommon. A 2015 study reported that, as of 2010, there were 4.7 million people in the U.S. who had received a total knee replacement. If partial knee replacement (also called a unicompartmental knee replacement, or UKR) is an option for many patients, and the partial version could improve outcomes and reduce medical costs, then this is a finding with the potential to significantly improve life for patients (and make U.S. insurers happier in the process). However, it’s important to highlight the risks associated with such a decision — even if those risks could potentially be reduced by seeing an increase in partial replacement surgeries over time. The importance of this research is that for some people a less-invasive surgical procedure may be an option, but the choice isn’t quite so clearcut as the researchers imply.",false,"""Many reports suggest that partial knee replacement is more beneficial than a full knee replacement.""","The study from Oxford University, as reported in the journal BMJ Open, suggests that partial knee replacements may be more beneficial than total knee replacements for many patients.

Why not? As our publisher, Gary Schwitzer, wrote: “The word promising means ‘likely to be successful’ or ‘to give a basis for expecting.’ There is far too much uncertainty in medicine for this word to be applied loosely in the coverage of medicine.” Despite this initial misstep, the story does quickly establish the preliminary nature of the research and cautions that it’s much too soon to know if the vaccine will ultimately be effective in preventing HIV infections. It also does a nice job of putting this research in context with other HIV prevention efforts that have succeeded in slowing the spread of the disease. More attention to the possible costs of a vaccine — a huge issue for the developing world countries most affected by the virus — would have rounded out this otherwise solid effort. This new vaccine approach, if proven ultimately to be effective, safe and affordable, could make a major difference in resource-poor settings around the world. But, as we’ve written about, the field of vaccine research related to HIV is littered with huge obstacles and there are never any guarantees that drug therapies will ever be accessible to the poorest parts of the world, where the need for a vaccine might be greatest.

257,257,10167,Anti-smoking drug receives FDA approval,"This is an evening network newscast story on the recent FDA approval of the drug varenicline (trade name Chantix) for smoking cessation. Given the time constraints of this news story, the reporters do an excellent job of even-handedly presenting the new drug in the context of other therapies for smoking cessation. Varenicline may be an option for those who have not been able to quit smoking using other drug treatments, such as the anti-depressant bupropion (trade name Zyban) or nicotine replacement therapy. Varenicline was given priority status and fast-tracked for approval due to the “significant improvement” over existing therapies for smoking cessation; however, the long-term benefit of varenicline over exiting therapies is not very significant. Approval of varenicline was largely based on two double-blind, randomized studies of 2000 smokers in which the drug was compared with bupropion (trade name Zyban) and a placebo. The studies were both funded by Pfizer, maker of varenicline. The news story presents longer-term (1 year) abstinence rates, which are important for evaluating smoking cessation therapies. Unfortunately, there is no discussion of side effects. Nausea, headaches, insomnia and other stomach problems were more common in the varenicline group, but none of these are mentioned in the broadcast. The cost of a 12-week course of varenicline is provided in context with a message that smoking is a strong addiction and that reliance on a pill alone may not be enough. There is a behavioral component to smoking cessation that is recognized even by Pfizer, which, in the press release announcing approval of varenicline for smoking cessation, also announces plans to offer varenicline users an interactive on-line support program. (Publisher’s Note: Although this review points out some flaws, this NBC story is to be applauded for what it achieved in the usual limited time afforded TV news stories.

The approval was fast-tracked due to its significant improvement over existing therapies, although the long-term benefits compared to other treatments are not very significant. Studies funded by Pfizer, the maker of varenicline, showed promising results in comparison to bupropion and a placebo, with higher abstinence rates after one year.

258,258,11351,Brain scan may someday detect autism,"The photo that ran with this story appeared straight out of a dystopian fantasy: a mother holding her infant, her shoulder draped in a loose, shawl-like lattice of wires connected to a swarm of electrodes attached to her baby’s head. Is this the future? Fortunately for readers, this story  did a better job than HealthDay in making better use of independent experts and didn’t allowing the lead author to get away with one of the more over-the-top statements that was quoted in the HealthDay story. But it did fail to explain the harms that may be associated with widespread use of scans or with false positives, the costs, and the alternatives to this type of screening. . Autism spectrum disorders are increasingly being diagnosed, yet the causes remain elusive and the treatments are far from a cure for most kids. Parents are hungry for solutions, as can be seen in the passionate comments below this article. What we do know is that early detection appears to be important because early intervention has shown promising results in mitigating the effects of the disorder. That’s why it is crucial for stories to carefully sort through the evidence to weed out the blips along the way from the true breakthroughs.",mixture,"""In the future, brain scans could potentially be used to detect autism.""","New Explanation:

259,259,11132,"Migraine drug could halve the length of attack , study show","The Guardian covers a new phase III clinical trial of erenumab, a drug injected monthly, designed to reduce the frequency of painful migraines. The piece does a good job putting the results into context and even compares those findings to the placebo group, giving them a more transparent and helpful context. However, readers would have appreciated being told more of the basics. What are the possible side effects? How much might the drug cost? How is this different from other migraine treatments? Many news organizations used more sensational “breakthrough” language than The Guardian did in this story. But this was still only half a loaf, inexplicably reporting on one migraine study in the New England Journal of Medicine without even mentioning or linking to another migraine study in the same journal with a somewhat similar antibody agent. Why? About one in four US homes and perhaps 12% of the US population (much of it female) experiences migraines, according to the Migraine Research Foundation, affecting the lives of hundreds of millions of people each year. There’s no cure-all for the severe headaches, and current treatments and preventative drugs can cause unwanted side effects like tiredness, dizziness, nausea, weakness, heart rate issues, and more. So any alternative that is both effective and safe would be good news. But, as Dr. Richard Lehman wrote on his terrific BMJ blog, “the real worry is that antibodies beget antibodies, and we don’t know how long these (drugs) will remain effective or what long-term harms they might have.” And The Guardian story didn’t adequately address either concern.",false,"""The study indicates that a drug used for treating migraines could potentially reduce the duration of the attack by half.""","The new drug erenumab, which is injected monthly, has shown promising results in reducing the frequency of painful migraines in a new phase III clinical trial.

(Editor's note, June 7, 2017: An earlier version of this item quoted Grothman as saying that Planned Parenthood is an outspoken advocate for ""controversial"" services such as birth control.

261,261,9748,Too Much Fat ? Try a Whole-Body Scan Procedure give far more data than a body-mass index,"A DXA body composition scan featured in the Wall Street Journal. The format of this story — with its hepful “Ache, Claim, Verdict” structure — suggests we are going to be treated to a no-nonsense examination of the evidence supporting dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, or DXA, for whole body scans to determine an individual’s body composition in terms of fat, bone and muscle. However, the story doesn’t deliver much more than a superficial look at the technology and is lacking in critical perspective. The story concludes that DXA is much more accurate than body mass index (BMI) at calculating someone’s body composition, but doesn’t give readers much information on why this may be important to their health. It focuses on the question of how often one should get scanned, and never challenges the assumption that one needs to get scanned at all. It doesn’t mention that there appears to be no data to show that those who use these scans have any better outcomes than those who do not. We live in a body-conscious society. It’s not clear precisely how much money people in the United States spend on weight loss. U.S. News, for example, reported in 2013 that we spend more than $60 billion a year on weight loss. A year earlier, ABC News pegged it at $20 billion. Regardless of which figure is closer to the mark, the weight loss industry is a juggernaut. And that doesn’t even get into the fitness industry focused on helping us have bigger muscles or more toned bodies. In short, people are extremely interested in losing fat and gaining muscle — and DXA appears to be a tool aimed at, to paraphrase this story, taking the guesswork out of figuring out how well you’re doing. It is, perhaps, inevitable that news outlets will cover this tool and its effectiveness. But these stories should also highlight how and whether they can give people insight into any potential medical problems — or whether it’s primarily a pricey tool for indulging our interest in our own bodies.",mixture,"""A Whole-Body Scan Procedure provides more detailed data compared to a body-mass index, especially when assessing body fat.""","The article discusses the use of DXA body composition scans as a more accurate method than BMI for determining body composition. However, it fails to provide in-depth information on the importance of this data for one's health and does not question the necessity of undergoing such scans. Additionally, there is no mention of any evidence showing improved health outcomes for individuals who undergo these scans. The article highlights the significant amount of money spent in the weight loss industry, indicating a strong societal focus on body image and fitness.

The article presents follow-up data from the landmark Women’s Health Initiaive on the risks and benefits of hormone therapy. The new data shows that at three years after stopping hormone therapy, there was no increased risk of heart disease in the hormone therapy group, however the increase in breast cancer risk did persist at three years. The story does not provide adequate details about alternatives to hormone therapy for menopausal symptoms or about lower-hormone options that could potentially confer less risk. The story does not quantify the risks of hormone therapy, in absolute terms or otherwise. This is particularly important for this subject because the risks involved are realtively small. For example, in the study, the risk of breast cancer was less than one half of one percent per year in the hormone therapy group. Furthermore, other than to describe the study as ""sweeping"", the story does not adequately describe the strength of the new evidence. Most importantly, the story does not explain that these findings do not necessarily apply to younger women who take hormone therapy for shorter periods of time. Overall, in focusing solely on the risks of hormone therapy, this story implies that it is not a reasonable choice for women.

The story appropriately mentions why traditional screening methods may miss an early-stage tumor in this population. It is not the usual standard to do any other screening (aside from mammogram) in women with dense breast tissue situations, except for very high-risk BRCA carriers who now get MRI as well. Ultrasound is already available, as implied in the story, and not a new method of treatment. The broadcast does not mention that physicians and ultrasonographers in the study were trained using standardized screening protocols. In a real-world clinical setting, the availability of properly training physicians and technicians can vary, resulting in greater false-negatives or false-positives.

288,288,9681,"Flashing night-light may help lessen jet lag , circadian problem","This study of flashing light therapy enrolled 39 people, and exposed 31 of them to a series of two-millisecond light flashes with changing intervals while sleeping. The other eight were exposed to 60 minutes of continuous bright light. Those who experienced the flashing light were more quickly able to alter their circadian clock and thus, in theory, more quickly adapt to a new time zone. The report covered the main bases found in the published research and, unlike a CNN article on the same study, included the helpful commentary of an outside observer who was able to add context to the meaning and impact of the study. Jet lag is a significant concern for many people who have to travel distances that span multiple time zones, where their ability to work effectively is compromised as the body struggles to adjust to a new time zone. This means a simple, but effective light therapy session could bring much-needed relief to those who have to travel but also, possibly, to those who do shift work and are frequently forced into combat against the body’s natural circadian rhythms. People who work in important jobs where alertness and quick adaptability to changing sleep schedules are required (airline pilots, doctors, nurses, ambulance attendants, truck drivers, etc) may benefit from such a therapy.",true,"""Jet lag, a subclass of circadian problems, may be alleviated by a flashing night-light.""","The study on flashing light therapy showed that exposure to two-millisecond light flashes with changing intervals while sleeping helped participants adjust their circadian clock more quickly.

309,309,9177,"New blood test may predict cardiovascular event in patient with or without coronary artery disease , research show","The news release reports on research suggesting that testing for plasma ceramides, a type of blood lipid, might enable doctors to identify individuals at higher risk for heart attacks and strokes even though they have healthy cholesterol levels and no evidence of coronary blockage. It provides a readable and reasonably straightforward account of what the researchers did and why it might be important, but there are a number of significant omissions. First, the release should have acknowledged that this test — even if it does effectively identify individuals at increased risk of a heart attack or stroke — may not lead to treatment that actually lowers that risk. Knowing about an increased risk doesn’t mean that risk can be reduced. Many other similar risk markers have been proposed over the years and so far haven’t been found very useful for actually guiding treatment that improves outcomes. Moreover, the research discussed in the release was being presented at a scientific meeting, meaning it has not yet gone through the peer-review process for publication in a journal. In addition, the news release provides no information about the costs of the new test, which appears to be available only through Mayo Medical Laboratories. It also does not discuss the possibility of false positive results, potentially leading to unnecessary treatment. Cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks and strokes, kills more Americans than any other disease, including cancer. Although health experts have long advised people to try to maintain low cholesterol levels – especially for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) – research suggests that as many as half of all heart attacks occur in individuals who have normal cholesterol levels. In addition, heart attacks can occur in individuals, especially women, for whom angiograms show no blockage of the coronary arteries.",mixture,"""Research indicates that a new blood test could forecast a cardiovascular event in individuals, regardless of whether they have coronary artery disease or not.""","The research indicates that a new blood test for plasma ceramides could help doctors identify individuals at higher risk of heart attacks and strokes, even if they have healthy cholesterol levels and no evidence of coronary blockage.

The article, as much about basic stem cell science as about medical treatment, focuses on one key researcher’s efforts to advance understanding of stem cells. The article puts those efforts in the context of politics, past and current research and the potential for clinical application. It personalizes the story without generating false emotion or hope. It’s a strong example of how journalists can educate the public about the importance and difficulties of scientific research–something that’s very useful against a backdrop of so much out-of-context, misleading reporting about the benefits and dangers of drugs and treatments. It’s particularly useful in an area where political interests have distorted some underlying scientific issues. The story could have been made even stronger if the author had talked to politically neutral people who for scientific reasons are less sanguine about the outcomes of stem cell research. The scientific community has endured years of having to defend the importance–indeed, the legality–of work with stem cells. This has resulted in a nearly united front in the field advancing the message that stem cell research is on the cusp of life-saving application and a transforming force in the history of medicine.

313,313,9889,Old drug could cure HIV-linked dementia,"Patients with HIV may develop dementia as a result of the virus in the brain or inflammation as a result of the illness. The typical symptoms of HIV-associated dementia include short-term memory loss, slowing of thinking, difficulties with complex tasks, and social withdrawal. Neurological symptoms such as hand tremor and gait difficulties are also common. This story is about a study that tested an anti-seizure medication, valproic acid (Depakote), on cognitive functioning in 22 patients in over a 10-week period. 16 people in the study had HIV-related cognitive impairment, while 6 did not. Valproic acid is FDA approved to prevent seizures, but it is currently also used off-label for treatment of certain mental illnesses and in Alzheimer’s patients, as it is thought to prevent or reverse cognitive decline. The storyâ€™s description of study design and results is incomplete and there is no quantitative data presented on benefits or side effects. The study only lasted 10 weeks, and while there was a trend towards improvement, the story made no explanation of what â€œimprovementâ€ means or how it was measured or in how many people it was observed. It is important that the journalist mentions the need for a larger clinical trial to replicate results. 22 people is a very small sample to suggest generalizability of the results in terms of treating HIV dementia with valproic acid, so the headline is overzealous. There is still no “cure” for HIV-related dementia and current non-experimental options for treating this condition are not mentioned. The story doesnâ€™t mention side effects of taking valproic acid. The quote that it is “safe and well-tolerated by this population” does not provide enough information for a piece reporting the results of a published study. Also, 10 weeks is not enough time to assess long-term side effects for this medication in HIV patients. Anti-convulsant drugs like Depakote can have serious side effects when taken long term. These include weight gain, edema, sleepiness, gastrointestinal problems and liver toxicity.",mixture,"""An old medication could potentially treat dementia caused by HIV.""","The study tested the anti-seizure medication valproic acid (Depakote) on cognitive functioning in 22 patients over a 10-week period.

318,318,10093,Concussions in kid are detectable by blood test,"This news release describes a recently published journal article on a study that evaluated a blood test that was designed to detect concussions or traumatic brain injury in children. The study reports that head injury causes the release of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) from the brain into the bloodstream, and that the levels of GFAP in the blood correspond to the severity of the head injury. According to the release, the blood test correctly identified the presence of concussion or traumatic brain injury in 94 percent of the cases. But the release fails to mention that many positive results from the test would be false-positives, which would result in additional testing and may pose additional health risks. The release notes that concussion and traumatic brain injury are usually diagnosed based on symptoms — such as perceived balance problems or reports of headaches or grogginess — and that the blood test provides an objective test that can be used for diagnosis. However, the release fails to speak to a more important aspect of the marker, that is it’s potential negative predictive value. As noted in the study the biomarker has a 98% negative predictive value. That means that a negative result, if the biomarker holds up to additional testing, would rule out concussion. According to the CDC, approximately 248,000 children were treated for concussions or traumatic brain injuries in U.S. emergency departments in 2009. And that number doesn’t include children who were taken to a family physician or who went misdiagnosed or undiagnosed. Concussions can have significant impacts on a child’s health and well-being, with symptoms ranging from headaches and dizziness to memory problems and behavioral changes. What’s more, the Mayo Clinic notes that having one concussion increases the risk of a child’s having a second concussion — and repeated concussions can have a multiplier effect. The development of an objective test that can accurately diagnose concussions in children without the use of CT scans, would certainly be a significant advance. However, it’s important to recognize the limitations of the current study and to address issues such as potential misdiagnosis.",false,"""Blood tests can be used to detect concussions in kids.""","The blood test evaluated in the study can detect concussions or traumatic brain injury in children by measuring the levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) released into the bloodstream due to head injury.

However, it is crucial to consider the potential for false-positive results, which may lead to further testing and associated health risks.

The chief deficiencies of either version of the article are that the reader is left without a sense of how effective the vaccine might be in the newly-targeted populations. The article could have been improved with an attempt at quantification of benefits or numbers needed to vaccinate as well as with richer interviews of more disinterested experts who could have filled in these areas. Some vague areas in the article are misleading: the vaccine does not in the best of circumstances prevent lung infection; pneumococcal infection is not synonymous with ""pneumonia;""  the vaccine may have no ""booster"" but revaccination is a common practice; and not all smokers are alike, making it unlikely that the CDC would recommend the vaccination indiscriminately.

348,348,10740,Weighing effectiveness versus risk in obesity drug,"This story endeavors in a noble task: providing readers with an assessment of the landscape for obesity drugs. We wish more stories took this broad view when writing about new drug studies or approvals. The article does a good job of framing the key issues, asking, essentially, whether is there enough benefit to justify the side effects. Not often do stories address this issue, and we applaud their approach. The story comes close to achieving a balance in its attempt to answer this question. For example, the statements by Thomas and Wolfe are excellent alternative opinions to the views espoused by the obesity drug expert camp. But we wish this story had gone beyond a he said/she said look at the evidence and that it had not relied so heavily on sources that have strong ties to the pharmaceutical industry, which is pushing hard for looser restrictions on anti-obesity drug approvals. There also is some clear disease-mongering in the article, which gives it the unsavory taste while you read it. As this story notes, a third of the US adult population is obese, and the situation has only worsened in recent years, despite concerted public health efforts to address this serious public health threat. Pills, though, are just one part of the equation. From reading this story, people might believe that the only reason people are obese is because they don’t have access to the right pills. How does this explain the huge contrast between the US and other developed countries in terms of obesity? How does this explain the rapid rise in average body-mass index over the past three decades and the resulting rise in diabetes, heart disease and other health problems? The story accepts as its underlying premise that obesity would melt away if drug companies could find the right pill and that they are being scared away by the big bad FDA. Even a story that is primarily focused on the drug industry and not the root causes of obesity should have given more weight to the evidence about the health problems resulting from obesity drugs.",false,"""The obesity drug is used for treatment, with its effectiveness and risk being weighed.""","The article evaluates the effectiveness and risks of obesity drugs, questioning whether the benefits outweigh the side effects.

364,364,14292,Hillary Clinton Says Bernie Sanders `` ha been largely a very reliable supporter of the NRA .,"Clinton said Sanders ""has been largely a very reliable supporter of the NRA."" This is a stretch. Sanders won his congressional bid about 25 years ago thanks at least in part to the NRA, and has voted against major pieces of gun control legislation. However, he has also cast votes for gun control and has received low marks from the NRA for the past 20 years. Neither the gun lobby nor gun control advocates claim Sanders as their own. 	Linda Qiu	Reeling from attacks over her ties to Wall Street, Hillary Clinton blasted Bernie Sanders over his own connections to a target of liberal ire: the gun lobby. """"He’s been largely a very reliable supporter of the NRA. He kept his word to the NRA. He voted against the Brady Bill five times,"""" Clinton said during the April 14 Democratic primary debate in New York. She’s right about his votes against background checks and waiting periods, which took place from 1991 to 1993. But what about her attack that Sanders has consistently supported the gun lobby? That’s a lot less accurate. Sanders has a mixed record when it comes to bills on guns and has actually received low marks from the National Rifle Association over his decades-long legislative career. Sanders’ gun votes In addition to Sanders’ Brady Bill votes, the Clinton campaign referred us to Sanders’ votes against funding for gun research, twice for prohibiting lawsuits against firearms manufacturers (""""what the head of the NRA called the most significant piece of pro-gun legislation in the last 20 years,"""" said Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin), for increasing the burden of proof to prosecute law-breaking gun dealers, and for allowing firearms on Amtrak trains and in national parks. Schwerin also noted that Sanders voted for an amendment in the Brady Bill that allows prospective gun owners to buy a firearm if their background checks are not completed in three days. This is the amendment that facilitated Dylann Roof to purchase his .45 caliber Glock pistol, which he used to kill nine people in a historically black church in Charleston in 2015. But on the flip side, Sanders also voted against the NRA’s wishes and in favor of banning assault weapons, closing the gun show loophole, regulating high capacity magazines, and expanding background checks in the wake of the Newtown elementary school massacre. We pulled together his votes on key gun bills over his 25 years in Congress (votes in bold reflect a pro-gun position): Year Legislation Sanders’ Vote Result 1993 Imposes a five-day waiting period and background checks on firearm purchases, part of the Brady Bill Nay Passed 1993 Imposes instant background checks instead for firearm purchases, part of amendment to Brady Bill Yea Passed 1993 Imposes an interim five-day waiting period while while waiting to put a instant background check system in place, part of Brady Bill conference report Nay Passed 1994 Bans semiautomatic assault weapons Yea Passed 1996 Increase funding for the Centers on Disease Control and Prevention by $2.6 million to research firearm-related injuries Nay Failed 1996 Repeals the semiautomatic weapon ban Nay Passed 1998 Increases minimum sentencing for gun crimes Yea Passed 1999 Creates """"instant check registrants"""" and narrowly defines """"gun shows,"""" part of Mandatory Gun Show Background Check Act Nay Failed 1999 Imposes three day waiting period for guns purchased at gun shows, part of amendment to gun show act Yea Failed 2002 Allows pilots and flight personnel to carry firearms in the cockpit Yea Passed 2003 Prohibits lawsuits against firearm makers for unlawful misuse of a firearm Yea Passed 2005 Prohibits lawsuits against firearm makers for unlawful misuse of a firearm Yea Passed 2006 Prohibits funds from being used to enforce trigger locks on guns Nay Passed 2006 Increases the burden of proof for the AFT to penalize law-breaking gun dealers, as part of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms reform bill Yea Passed 2007 Prohibits foreign aid funding restrictions on U.S. gun ownership, as an amendment to the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2008 Yea Passed 2008 Prevents the use of funds for anti-gun programs as an amendment to the Indian Health Care Improvement Act Yea Passed 2009 Gives the District of Columbia seats in the House of Representatives and repeals district’s ban on semi-automatics Yea Passed 2009 Allows the use of firearms in National Parks Yea Passed 2009 Allows concealed and carry across state lines Nay Failed 2009 Allows firearms in checked baggage on Amtrak trains, as an amendment to congressional budget Yea Passed 2009 Prohibits higher insurance premiums for gun owners, as part of an amendment to the Affordable Care Act Yea Passed 2013 Prevents the U.S. from entering the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty, as an amendment to congressional budget Nay Passed 2013 Allows concealed and carry across state lines in states where the practice is not prohibited Nay Failed 2013 Lists all people prohibited buying a firearm in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System Yea Failed 2013 Bans high-capacity ammunition magazines carrying more than 10 rounds Yea Failed 2013 Bans assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines Yea Failed Neither a ‘gun-lobby lapdog’ nor an ‘anti-gunner’ The Clinton campaign also noted that the NRA helped elect Sanders to the House of Representatives in 1990. While it’s true that Sanders and the gun lobby were on the same side in that election, their alignment was temporary. The NRA backed Republican incumbent Peter Smith in his 1988 race against Sanders. But Smith didn’t stick to his guns and came out in favor of an assault weapons ban after he won. Feeling betrayed, the gun group spent $18,000 attacking the incumbent in 1990 and issued bumper stickers emblazoned with images of Smith as Pinocchio and """"Dump Pete Smith,"""" Garrison Nelson, a professor of state politics at the University of Vermont previously told PolitiFact. Paul Blackman, a former NRA research associate, told us in 2015 that while Sanders wasn’t exactly pro-gun and the NRA wasn’t explicitly pro-Sanders, he seemed like the lesser of two evils. """"I don't remember whether we ever made a pro-Sanders statement, but we certainly made it clear that Vermonters should vote against Rep. Smith, and everyone understood that to mean we were supporting, directly or indirectly, the election of Sanders,"""" he said. """"Our people were satisfied that he was less bad than -- not equally bad as -- Smith."""" """"It was an awkward situation for Bernie. Sort of like the enemy of my enemy is my friend,"""" said Chris Graff, the former Vermont AP bureau chief. """"The NRA did not campaign for him but Bernie did oppose the Brady Bill. ... I do believe that Bernie ‘owed’ the NRA when he first went to Congress."""" Since 1990, however, Sanders and the NRA seemed to part ways. Brady Campaign president Dan Gross said Sanders has shown suppleness and evolution since his first days in Congress, adding he isn’t a """"gun lobby lapdog."""" Blackman, the former NRA researcher, said the group doesn’t consider Sanders """"an anti-gunner."""" Warren Gunnels, Sanders’ policy director, noted that Sanders’ latest grade from the NRA was a D. In fact, Sanders has earned failing grades from the NRA for the past two decades. His highest mark was a C-, a barely passing grade that doesn’t amount to full-throated support. (The group has not graded Sanders in 2016.)

377,377,9913,New Study Published on Cover of Urology Finds that Decipher® Prostate Cancer Classifier Reduces Conflicting Treatment Recommendations between Urologists and Radiation Oncologists,"In this news release, we’re introduced to a world of confusion among doctors about what to do with a man after they remove his cancerous, walnut-sized prostate gland. And the release offers something that can allegedly reduce that confusion: GenomeDx Biosciences’ Decipher, a test that sniffs out 22 different genetic signals of how a cancer case might play out. Next we’re told about the struggle between urologists and radiation oncologists. The former group is less likely than the latter to prescribe “adjuvant therapy,” typically radiation, after removing a prostate gland. Missing high-risk cancer cases and not treating them is a problem, of course, but so is treating men who probably don’t need it. (Although we’re never really told why that’s an issue.) According to the release, Decipher has the ability to change the minds of both urologists (45%) and radiation oncologists (35%), and get more of them to agree what or what not to do with a patient after removal of his cancerous prostate gland. That’s potentially an important advance, but we aren’t provided with crucial context — notably that it’s unclear if the decisions made because of Decipher were actually better decisions that would lead to a reduction in prostate cancer deaths. We’re also never cautioned about the small size of the study, given cost information about the test, or told about potential harms. Among cancers in men, prostate cancer is the second-most common – about 1 in 5 men in the U.S. will get a diagnosis in their lifetimes. It’s also the second-most deadly: Of the more than 200,000 men diagnosed each year in the U.S., nearly 30,000 die. (At least twice as many more black men succumb to prostate cancer as other ethnic groups.) Testing prostate cancer for how likely it is to grow quickly and migrate (metastasize) might save a lot of men from unnecessary follow-up treatments and unwanted side effects. So, a reliable tool to help clinicians make informed choices – and with a consensus of opinion among the doctors a patient sees – stands to help everyone while reducing costs associated with prostate cancer.",mixture,"""A recent Urology study, featured on its cover, reveals that the Decipher® Prostate Cancer Classifier minimizes differing treatment suggestions between Urologists and Radiation Oncologists.""","The Decipher® Prostate Cancer Classifier test by GenomeDx Biosciences can reduce conflicting treatment recommendations between urologists and radiation oncologists by providing genetic signals on how a cancer case might progress.

381,381,9623,Program Cut Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infections,"HealthDay highlights a national effort to help reduce an uncomfortable and costly problem: hospital-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs), and specifically those caused by indwelling catheters. These devices are tubes that snake up the urethra into a person’s bladder, are anchored there with an inflatable balloon, and continuously drain a patient’s urine. HealthDay nicely captures the scope of the problem, noting that one in five hospital patients are catheterized, and that, of these, 20% are bound to get a UTI. Looking at a typical year, this adds up to about 250,000 hospital-acquired UTIs and roughly $250 million in healthcare costs. The story included quotes from Dr. Sanjay Saint, the lead author of the new study, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). The story breaks down his team’s effort to attack catheter-caused UTIs with a program called “Stop CAUTI,” which is a government-sponsored training toolkit to not only reduce indwelling catheterization rates, but also help caretakers use better technique when they have to insert the devices. The results, as HealthDay explains them? It’s not clear; we’re not given many quantified benefits or study details, and the results that are included happen to conflict with each other. Also missing was a discussion around limitations of the research. Indwelling catheters are very common sights at hospitals, since nurses can insert them once and they rarely slip out (a balloon at the end holds them in place). However, about 75% of UTIs are caused by such catheters, according to the CDC, and more than two-thirds of those infections are thought to be avoidable — both through better caretaker training and by avoiding the use of indwelling catheters. Given the suffering and cost, any program that could decrease the rate of such infections, especially one without any new medical devices — just training sessions and use of alternative, short-term catheterization — would be welcomed by patients, hospitals, insurance companies, and taxpayers alike.",true,"""The program reduced the incidence of catheter-associated urinary tract infections.""","The program ""Stop CAUTI"" aims to reduce hospital-acquired urinary tract infections caused by indwelling catheters through government-sponsored training sessions and promoting the use of alternative, short-term catheterization techniques.","[{'subject': 'catheter', 'predicate': 'subclass of', 'object': 'urinary tract infection'}, {'subject': 'catheter', 'predicate': 'medical condition treated', 'object': 'urinary tract infection'}, {'subject': 'catheter-associated urinary tract infection', 'predicate': 'instance of', 'object': 'incidence'}]","[{'subject': 'program', 'predicate': 'reduced', 'object': 'incidence of urinary tract infections'}, {'subject': 'program', 'predicate': 'incidence of', 'object': 'associated urinary tract infections'}, {'subject': 'program', 'predicate': 'reduced', 'object': 'incidence of catheter associated urinary tract infections'}, {'subject': 'program', 'predicate': 'reduced', 'object': 'incidence of associated urinary tract infections'}, {'subject': 'program', 'predicate': 'incidence of', 'object': 'catheter associated urinary tract infections'}, {'subject': 'program', 'predicate': 'incidence of', 'object': 'catheter associated tract infections'}, {'subject': 'program', 'predicate': 'reduced', 'object': 'incidence of associated tract infections'}, {'subject': 'program', 'predicate': 'incidence of', 'object': 'urinary tract infections'}, {'subject': 'program', 'predicate': 'incidence of', 'object': 'associated tract infections'}, {'subject': 'program', 'predicate': 'reduced', 'object': 'incidence'}, {'subject': 'program', 'predicate': 'reduced', 'object': 'incidence of catheter associated tract infections'}, {'subject': 'program', 'predicate': 'incidence of', 'object': 'tract infections'}, {'subject': 'program', 'predicate': 'reduced', 'object': 'incidence of tract infections'}]","[{'subject': 'program', 'predicate': 'reduced of', 'object': 'incidence'}]"

395,395,9396,How barbershop could help lower blood pressure,"This well-written CNN story describes a multi-year study that looked at whether providing blood pressure screening and access to pharmacists in black-owned barber shops might be effective in reducing high blood pressure among the African-American men who patronize these establishments. The study was presented as part of the 67th annual scientific session of the American Association of Cardiologists. The story is strong and scores well because it discusses critical data from the study, offers comments from independent sources and provides information on limitations. It didn’t delve into either costs or harms, but in this case, there seems to be minimal need for either, due to the nature of the research. One minor point we think the story could have made: It remains to be seen if this style of intervention ultimately leads to a reduced risk of stroke, serious heart disease, and/or heart attacks, especially if there is not a long-term barbershop program in place. This was a unique choice for a study presented at the ACC conference. Often, the studies presented at the conference are industry-funded and focus on specific (and often very expensive) drugs or devices.

400,400,9692,Cortisol level in child 's hair may reveal future mental health risk,"This story reports that in an Australian study of 70 children (average age 9.5 years), those who had experienced a higher number of traumatic events also had higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol in samples of their hair. The researchers are hypothesizing that the cortisol levels might be a marker of future mental health problems in the children, as people with depression and other mental health problems, as well as physical problems like diabetes, sometimes have high levels of cortisol. Here’s the problem with this story: The study being reported on never actually looked at whether cortisol levels had anything to do with future mental health diagnoses. And in fact, cortisol levels were found not to be correlated with current depressive symptoms in these children. Moreover, the study had such a small sample as to make any conclusions resulting from it highly uncertain. So it’s a huge stretch to claim that cortisol in hair “may reveal future mental health risk” in children. We wish the story had been more cautious, especially in its headline, when discussing the implications of this very preliminary research. Childhood lays the foundation for one’s health over a lifetime, so identifying people who have risk factors for health problems early on — as with a simple hair test — is an attractive idea. This might allow for early intervention to modify risk and get people into treatment sooner, lessening the impact of disease or behavioral problems on their lives.",false,"""The level of cortisol in a child's hair is a facet of mental health and may indicate a future risk for mental health issues.""","The study suggests that higher levels of cortisol in children's hair may be linked to a higher number of traumatic events, potentially indicating future mental health risks.

The release offers no discussion on costs of viscosupplementation or insurance coverage restrictions. The benefit data is limited and there are no mention of harms. The article upon which this recommendation is based won’t be published until January 2016 which makes these limitations much more critical. Osteoarthritis of the knee is the most common form of arthritis and can be seen as a normal part of aging and of “wear and tear” of the body. It occurs most often in people over age 50 and more often in women than in men. It’s degenerative, getting worse over time. With the aging of the US population, especially considering the crush of baby boomers, the subject of how best to manage the pain and disability seen with osteoarthritis of the knee becomes important. While viscosupplementation has been available for many years, the majority of randomized clinical trials have not demonstrated a consistent or important benefit to either pain level or functionality from this therapy. A terse, vaguely worded and incomplete release does little to inform either the general public or the clinical community.",false,"""Viscosupplementation is suggested as a treatment for suitable patients suffering from Knee Osteoarthritis.""","The therapy called viscosupplementation involves injecting hyaluronic acid to act as a lubricant and alleviate pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis, particularly senior citizens.

423,423,10822,"Mammograms Save Lives for Women in Their 40 , Study Says","The story focuses on results of a Swedish large study that showed a survival benefit from annual breast cancer screening for women in their 40s. This story also briefly reviews a recent study reported at the same conference, however, dealing with survival from breast cancer. Simply put, these are two separate issues (screening and survival) and it is very confusing to put the results and comments together in the same piece. Perhaps largely because the story doesn’t adequately evaluate the quality of the evidence of the new Swedish study, it has an unbalanced feel of promoting annual mammograms based on this recenty published data and via the selection of experts cited. The downsides of screening for women 40-49 are not discussed at all. While this story begins telling readers that ""Another study…finds that screening can lower the risk of dying…"" –  look at how other competing stories began:   4th paragraph of AP story: ""The new study has major limitations and cannot account for possibly big differences in the groups of women it compares."" 1st paragraph of LA Times blog story:  ""Critics charged that the study was poorly designed and potentially vastly misleading."" 2nd sentence of NY Times story:  ""Results were greeted with skepticism by some experts who say they may have overestimated the benefit."" No such skepticism, no such independent critical evaluation took place in the HealthDay story. Women – especially in their 40s – must be terribly confused by the swirling studies. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations last November, the American Cancer Society and others’ backlash against it, the Norwegian study in the New England Journal of Medicine, and now the new Swedish study.

While calling results “encouraging,” the news release would be more helpful if it provided a meaningful assessment of whether this therapy might advance the Moon Shot’s directive of saving lives.

It is found mainly in older adults, with an average age in the early 60s. The risk of being diagnosed with anal cancer during one’s lifetime is about 1 in 500, with women at slightly higher risk.

The chemotherapy and radiation protocols that have been used to treat anal cancer have remained little changed since the 1970s, and there is no FDA-approved chemotherapy drug specific to anal cancer, according to the HPV and Anal Cancer Foundation.

443,443,9676,More support for osteoporosis drug,"This thorough, well-researched story focuses on the debate over how and whether bisphosphonates should be used to treat osteoporosis, and provides a general overview of the related risks and potential benefits. The story does many things well — and addresses cost, potential conflicts of interest, and disease mongering particularly well. However, the story cites benefit numbers from a recent New England Journal of Medicine paper without giving readers any information about the study or where those numbers came from. Providing more context on those benefit numbers would have made the story stronger. Osteoporosis is not uncommon. Estimates of osteoporosis occurrence (and severity) vary, but a 2014 study estimated that more than 10 million people in the U.S. have osteoporosis. Osteoporosis increases the risk of bone injuries, such as hip fractures, that can have significant impacts on a patient’s health and quality of life. A 2007 study estimated that 65 percent of women who develop osteoporosis, and 42 percent of men who develop osteoporosis, will suffer a bone fracture in their lifetime. In short, many people will have to make decisions about how to prevent or treat osteoporosis. If there are complicated issues surrounding widely-used treatment options — as is the case with bisphosphonates — there is real value in news stories that attempt to untangle those issues for readers. That also makes it particularly important for such stories to clearly address everything from the financial ties of expert sources to the quality of the evidence tied to health risks and benefits.",true,"""The osteoporosis drug is used for the treatment of the medical condition known as osteoporosis.""","The article provides a detailed analysis of the debate surrounding the use of bisphosphonates for treating osteoporosis, highlighting both the risks and potential benefits.

452,452,11565,Yoga and Stretching Equally Effective for Back Pain,"An independent expert can point out whether a study is valid and relevant and whether any cautionary notes should accompany its conclusions. The article provided an accurate, bare-bones description of the study and its main conclusions—that yoga and intensive stretching were similarly effective and were both superior to the self-care intervention. But it also missed several key points, as detailed in the scoring below. And since the study in the Archives of Internal Medicine was actually accompanied by an independent commentary that could have been cited, these omissions are all the more telling. So what points might an independent expert have added to the coverage?The most important one is that the subjects in this study were relatively affluent and generally had mild back pain and modest functional limitations. The results of this study may not apply to the large body of patients from less affluent backgrounds with more severe back pain, greater functional impairment, and more complex health problems. Would a roughneck on an oil rig, an auto mechanic, or a hotel maid gain a similar benefit from yoga or intensive stretching as the subjects in this study? No one really knows. The availability of these treatments is also an issue. Similarly structured viniyoga programs may not be available in many communities—and it is not clear that most health insurance plans will cover them. The type of intensive stretching program described in this study would appear to be uncommon in the United States. So most patients wouldn’t have access to this intervention. Lastly, this study did not compare yoga and intensive stretching to “usual care”. So yoga and intensive stretching may be superior to a self-care program, but it is not as clear that they are any better than routine back care as dispensed across the United States. In the United States, back pain is the ninth most expensive medical condition for women, and the 10th for men, in terms of direct medical costs—with chronic back pain accounting for a disproportionate chunk of those expenses. And the costs of work absence and disability claims related to back pain vastly exceed the medical price tag. Though Americans spend almost $35 billion per year on the medical treatment of back pain, the prevalence of chronic back pain appears to be rising—and self-rated spinal health among Americans appears be declining. (See Soni, 2011; Freburger et al., 2008; and Martin et al., 2008). A number of nonsurgical treatments—analgesics, exercise, manual therapies, complementary/alternative therapies, psychological interventions, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation—are modestly effective in the management of chronic back pain. Yet for various reasons, Americans overuse ineffective treatments and underuse effective ones. (See Carey et al., 2009). So the identification of treatments that facilitate recovery and are popular with patients is a key social and medical priority.

462,462,9142,Cannabis Derivative Cannabidiol Reduces Seizures in Severe Epilepsy Disorder,"This release from the NYU Langone Medical Center describes a randomized placebo controlled clinical trial of children and adolescents with Dravet syndome, an extreme form of epilepsy, who often don’t respond to other drugs. The release provides a very good description of the benefits and the side effects that were reported from the trial. It adds cautions and nuance that are missing from many news releases. But not included were the cost of the new drug (projected to be quite steep) and we think the release could have emphasized more that the children in the trial were already on seizure medications. When the cannabidiol (or a placebo) was added to the maintenance drug it alleviated seizures but also introduced a high degree of side effects. A CNN story on the study, which we also reviewed, had many of the same strengths as the news release (overall depth and detail on benefits), but it similarly skipped cost information. Dravet syndrome is a rare form of epilepsy that generally begins in a child’s first year but is a life-long condition, according to the Epilepsy Foundation. Currently, treatments for this condition are marginal and new therapies addressing its symptoms would be welcome. The trial showed reduced seizures in this difficult-to-treat type of epilepsy compared to patients given a placebo. The lead researcher stressed that the study only tested cannabidiol in patients “with especially severe forms who have not responded to numerous medications”  and that the drug is not a panacea for other forms of epilepsy.",true,"""Cannabidiol, a derivative of cannabis, is used to treat severe epilepsy disorder by reducing seizures.""","The clinical trial discussed in the NYU Langone Medical Center release focused on children and adolescents with Dravet syndrome, a severe form of epilepsy resistant to conventional drugs.

471,471,9093,"Small increase in physical activity reduce immobility , disability risk in older adult","This university news release describes results of a study of sedentary elderly Americans enrolled in a federally funded study designed to document and improve their physical mobility and function. The release does a good job of describing the study methods and the conclusion that a modest increase of at least 48 minutes a week of moderately intense walking and walking-based strengthening exercises achieved significant, if not dramatic, decreases in average overall risk of major mobility disability over a two-year-plus period of time. It also paid appropriate attention to the “dose-dependent” benefits of the exercise regimen as compared to the control group’s health education classes. That is, the greater the increase in minutes of exercise, the greater the benefits on average overall. It also noted the researchers’ conclusion that although 150 minutes of exercise a week was the goal, seeing benefits at just 48 minutes does have implications for exercise compliance rates and the likelihood that even elderly couch potatoes might devote 15 minutes or so a few days a week to stay healthier. The release didn’t include any numbers summarizing and putting the results in context. It also would have been strengthened by including a more detailed description of what “sedentary” referred to. One notable inclusion was a paragraph devoted to weaknesses in the study. Bravo for that. As the U.S. population ages, increasing numbers of elderly signal their desire to live independently, and evidence for the benefits of consistent and persistent exercise grows, researchers, geriatricians and the public are clearly interested in identifying optimal and safe exercise regimens that people can do on their own, that don’t require gym memberships or expensive equipment, and that — most of all– that people will stick to over the long haul. For many over 70 or 75 years of age, even half an hour a day can seem overwhelming. Thus, research suggesting that 20 minutes a day of moderately intense walking (with or without ankle weights), stretching, and balance exercises is a reasonable goal. Studies designed to demonstrate with some confidence that even moderate exercise can contribute to reduced risk of disability are likely to attract interest among caregivers and the public.",mixture,"""Physical activity, even in small increments, can reduce the risk of immobility and subsequent disability in older adults.""","Increasing physical activity by at least 48 minutes a week through moderately intense walking and strengthening exercises can significantly reduce the risk of major mobility disability in older adults, according to a study on sedentary elderly Americans.

We applaud its restrained tone but would have liked to get a sense of how much symptom improvement patients experienced during the six-week trial as well as a discussion of costs and availability of these two treatment options. This release says the effectiveness of steroid injections “is increasingly being questioned. An equally effective treatment with fewer adverse side effects would be beneficial.” To conclude that dry needling is “not inferior” to a treatment that isn’t very effective doesn’t say much. There is no slam-dunk treatment for chronic hip pain. But if it comes with low risk and a modest cost, dry needling might be an alternative to steroids for combating chronic pain. Also, dry needling might offer an option for patients who haven’t felt relief from steroids or are precluded from taking them due to medication interactions. As the release states, GTPS is very common and at times very painful. A safe, successful treatment that rapidly resolves pain (beyond normal natural healing) would benefit many individuals.

489,489,12525,The GOP health bill `` would once again allow being a rape or domestic violence victim to be a pre-existing condition .,"Various bloggers, and some members of Congress, wrote that under the House Republican health plan, sexual assault and domestic violence is a pre-existing condition. Several websites have since softened their headlines to be more careful, going from ""would"" to ""could."" The bill does not change what is or is not a pre-existing condition; the health insurance companies write those definitions for themselves. The House bill also does not single out sexual assault or any other medical issue as a pre-existing condition. Prior to the Affordable Care Act, some victims of sexual assault said they had trouble getting health insurance because they sought medical services that the insurance companies viewed as evidence of a pre-existing condition, such as for sexually transmitted illness or mental health. The Republican bill might make it harder for people who have pre-existing conditions to get affordable health care coverage. Victims of sexual assault would face the same challenge as others with pre-existing conditions. But we don’t know for sure given the bill’s current form. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. UPDATE: This fact check has been updated with a response from Rep. Chu, who issued a statement on May 10, 2017, which reads in full: ""As it stands today, anybody with a preexisting condition is protected thanks to the Affordable Care Act. This includes women, who were previously charged more for a range of care that is, today, considered ‘essential’. The AHCA makes it easier for insurers to earn waivers to charge more for preexisting conditions and leaves the question of what should be covered up to others. In my statement, I said that this bill ‘would once again allow a rape or domestic violence victim to be a pre-existing condition.’ While the many fact checks have pointed out that a number of conditions would have to be met first, like state waivers, the fact is that what is currently prohibited has once again become possible thanks to the AHCA. We should not even be discussing how women can be charged more for their care, even if it requires 2, 3, or 4 extra steps.

The story includes input from an array of expert sources and offers a broad (if vague) overview of the research literature regarding therapy animals.

However, in sum, the story effectively conveys the lack of scientific consensus regarding how effective therapy animals are at reducing stress. Tackling the efficacy of therapy animals is a challenging subject, given that the story evaluates an absence of conclusive evidence. However, it’s an important subject. For example, therapy dogs can be expensive, which means a family may spend a great deal of money on a therapy animal — with little idea of whether the animal will provide meaningful benefits for a patient. Limited resources are available to help patients dealing with mental health issues, and it is important to ensure that those resources are used to achieve the maximum possible benefit. Resources that are being spent on unproven interventions are, obviously, not being used on interventions that have proven clinical benefits. This is the sort of thoughtful reporting we are always happy to see.",true,"""Therapy animals are widely used in the field of therapy, but evidence of their effectiveness is lacking.""","The explanation highlights the lack of scientific consensus on the effectiveness of therapy animals in reducing stress.

499,499,9184,Receiving a clot-buster drug before reaching the hospital may reduce stroke disability,"Mobile stroke unit, University of Tennessee College of Medicine Photo: Business Wire Clot busting drugs are an established part of the tool kit in reducing damage related to strokes. Understanding exactly when to administer them is key to making sure they are used in the most effective way possible. This release describes a study of one mobile stroke unit’s experience administering clot-busting drugs — or tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). These study findings have not been peer reviewed for publication in a journal and appear to have major caveats around them. We won’t know all the details until the full study is published, and so we were pleased to see some caution expressed in the news release. A few more additions, like cost information and a better explanation of the benefits, would have helped make this release even better. [Editor’s note: A reference to clot-busting drugs “saving lives” was removed from the review. As noted in the comments section, the scope of benefits offered by tPA is controversial and the American Heart Association withdrew “life-saving” claims about tPA as discussed in these BMJ and Mother Jones stories.] The recent deployment of a handful of mobile stroke units across the country staffed with specialists and CT scanners makes this a timely release, particularly amidst the backdrop of unsustainable health care costs. The cost of outfitting all US cities with these types of units would be very great, and most of the new mobile units have been funded by private donors. Mobile stroke units could be most useful in remote areas where there is a long transport time from the scene to a hospital that could give thrombolytic therapy, but those areas are the least likely to have enough volume of patients to sustain the expertise of the mobile stroke unit’s staff.",mixture,"""The administration of a clot-buster drug, a specific type of medication, prior to hospital arrival could potentially decrease the severity of stroke disability.""",Administering a clot-buster drug before reaching the hospital can help reduce stroke disability.,"[{'subject': 'clot-buster drug', 'predicate': 'subclass of', 'object': 'medication'}, {'subject': 'clot-buster', 'predicate': 'subclass of', 'object': 'medication'}, {'subject': 'clot-buster drug', 'predicate': 'instance of', 'object': 'medication'}]","[{'subject': 'administration', 'predicate': 'severity of', 'object': 'stroke disability'}, {'subject': 'clot buster drug', 'predicate': 'type of', 'object': 'medication'}]","[{'subject': 'administration', 'predicate': 'of of to decrease of', 'object': 'severity'}]"

At its core, this claim is an oversimplification of a much more complex issue. Recent independent data suggests that survival rates for captive and wild orcas are about equal, but that by itself isn't all that significant, experts told us. The data is limited and comparisons between orcas in captivity and in the wild are tenuous.

It will be important to see how these people do in the long-run–if the remission stands the test of time.",mixture,"""A new study finds that weight loss can indeed reverse diabetes.""","The study discussed in the Time article highlights the potential of reversing recently diagnosed diabetes through significant weight loss. The article effectively explains the impact of diabetes on the body and how medications address blood sugar levels without tackling the root cause. While the study's methods and results are well-described, it overlooks any potential drawbacks, such as the possible adverse effects or expenses associated with the strict diet required for weight loss. The significant aspect of this study is the high adherence rate of nearly 80% to the short-term extreme dietary intervention, followed by a less stringent approach, resulting in diabetes remission for a considerable number of participants. Monitoring the long-term outcomes of these individuals will be crucial to determine the sustainability of the remission.","[{'subject': 'weight loss', 'predicate': 'has effect', 'object': 'diabetes'}, {'subject': 'weight loss', 'predicate': 'facet of', 'object': 'diabetes'}, {'subject': 'weight loss', 'predicate': 'has effect', 'object': 'diabetes'}, {'subject': 'diabetes', 'predicate': 'has cause', 'object': 'weight loss'}]","[{'subject': 'weight loss', 'predicate': 'indeed reverse', 'object': 'diabetes'}, {'subject': 'weight loss', 'predicate': 'reverse', 'object': 'diabetes'}]","[{'subject': 'study', 'predicate': 'finds', 'object': 'diabetes'}]"

567,567,11081,Gastric Balloon in a Pill Helps Patients Lose Weight Without Surgery or Endoscopy,"This release describes a new type of gastric balloon being developed that is inserted via a pill rather than through endoscopy. The interim study on the device was presented at an obesity medical conference and has not been peer-reviewed. The approach appears to be novel; a capsule containing a collapsed balloon is swallowed, then filled with water via a small attached catheter that remains outside the patient’s mouth. After four months, a valve on the balloon opens and the balloon deflates and is excreted by the body. The small patient group (34 volunteers) in the study lost an average of 22 pounds after four months. The device’s main advantage is that it is non-invasive (except for a small catheter which some could find uncomfortable) but the release is based on data that has not been peer-reviewed or published. The release played down the limited evidence base and possible harms and neglected costs. Obesity appears to be a problem that isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says America, at least, appears stuck in unhealthy lifestyle paterns. One-in-three Americans is obese. Obesity is a leading contributor to dozens of other health conditions. As a result, millions of people turn to  gastric bypass, and the less intrusive (and less effective) gastric balloon and other medical procedures to try to lose weight when other methods fail. It seems the more effective the procedure is in taking off the weight, the more complications arise. The Eprise gastric balloon pill described in the release claims to be as effective but less intrusive as current methods. If it proves effective, it could be a welcome addition to the weight-loss arsenal.",mixture,"""The Gastric Balloon in a Pill is used to help patients lose weight without the need for surgery or endoscopy, highlighting that endoscopy is a different procedure but also a subclass of surgery.""","The new gastric balloon being developed is inserted via a pill, eliminating the need for surgery or endoscopy.

588,588,11395,Shire Announces Positive Results of SHP465 Safety and Efficacy Study in Children and Adolescents with ADHD,"This news release announces the results of a randomized, controlled Phase 3 clinical trial of a long-acting stimulant drug for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents. The pharmaceutical company Shire completed this follow-up trial on the drug’s safety and efficacy after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required more data when Shire first sought approval for the drug. The drug was tested in children and adolescents aged 6-17 years old with ADHD. The company claims that the drug showed significant improvement in both children and adolescents when compared with a placebo and on the clinical global impression improvement scale, a standardized measurement of improvement. While the release is clearly targeted to investors and financial reporters, it was distributed and made available to a wide public audience. Just because a release is written for a business audience does not mean it should skimp on transparency. Its biggest weakness is the strong claims it makes without providing any links or references to published research where the results can be evaluated. We perused the company’s website for details of the study but came up empty-handed. The news release doesn’t mention the lead investigator’s financial relationship with the drug sponsor, projected costs of the new drug, nor make any comparisons with numerous similar drugs already on the market. This news release matters to the company since it is aiming to launch a new formulation (currently referred to as SHP465) of a drug similar to Adderall, also developed by Shire, which faces generic competitors. The new formulation essentially comes with a new patent for an old drug — the main difference being a longer half-life (or longer daytime effect) — 16 hours versus 12 hours for the current Adderall extended release pill. As the news release states, this new launch would extend Shire’s patent on its “ADHD Franchise” for many years: “Protection for Shire‘s ADHD Franchise Extends to 2029 “There are patents supporting Shire’s overall ADHD franchise in the U.S. that extend to 2029. With a launch planned for the second half of  2017, Shire expects that SHP465, following potential FDA approval, will have three years of Hatch-Waxman exclusivity and at least three patents listed in the FDA Orange Book expiring as late as May 2029.” The news of a new drug formulation might be important for children and adolescents with ADHD who are frequently given amphetamines to treat their symptoms. But it is unclear how this drug differs from existing amphetamines already in use.",mixture,"""Shire, the parent organization, has announced positive results from the SHP465 Safety and Efficacy Study in Children and Adolescents, which is aimed at treating ADHD.""","The announcement highlights the successful outcome of a study conducted by Shire on the safety and effectiveness of SHP465 in treating ADHD in children and adolescents. The study, a Phase 3 clinical trial, was a follow-up to address additional data requirements from the FDA. Results indicated significant improvement in both age groups compared to a placebo, as measured by the clinical global impression improvement scale. However, the announcement lacks transparency by not providing links to published research, details on the lead investigator's financial ties, projected costs of the new drug, or comparisons with existing medications. The launch of SHP465, a new formulation with an extended patent, is part of Shire's strategy to maintain market exclusivity for its ADHD franchise until 2029. This development may impact individuals currently using amphetamines for ADHD treatment, although the specific advantages of SHP465 over existing medications remain unclear.","[{'subject': 'SHP465 Safety and Efficacy Study in Children and Adolescents', 'predicate': 'main subject', 'object': 'ADHD'}, {'subject': 'SHP465 Safety and Efficacy Study in Children and Adolescents', 'predicate': 'facet of', 'object': 'ADHD'}, {'subject': 'SHP465', 'predicate': 'facet of', 'object': 'ADHD'}]","[{'subject': 'Efficacy Study', 'predicate': 'is aimed at', 'object': 'ADHD'}, {'subject': 'Efficacy Study', 'predicate': 'is aimed at', 'object': 'treating ADHD'}, {'subject': 'Shire', 'predicate': 'positive results from', 'object': 'SHP465 Safety'}, {'subject': 'SHP465 Safety', 'predicate': 'is in', 'object': 'Children'}, {'subject': 'Shire', 'predicate': 'positive results from', 'object': 'SHP465 Safety in Children'}, {'subject': 'Shire', 'predicate': 'results from', 'object': 'SHP465 Safety in Children'}, {'subject': 'Shire', 'predicate': 'results from', 'object': 'SHP465 Safety'}, {'subject': 'Efficacy Study', 'predicate': 'is', 'object': 'aimed'}]","[{'subject': 'Shire', 'predicate': 'announced from in at', 'object': 'results'}]"

597,597,9138,Starving prostate cancer with what you eat for dinner,"This news release attempts to translate preliminary research on plant chemicals into actionable dietary advice. Bad move. Researchers used an innovative screening strategy to cull through 142 natural compounds to identify a combination of three phytochemicals — found in foods such as turmeric, apple peels and red grapes — that inhibited the growth of implanted prostate tumors in mice. Their work is described in the online journal Precision Oncology. But it’s a big leap from the lab table to the dinner table, where the release says that by indulging in certain foods, you can “enjoy the fact that you are eating something that could play a role starving — or even preventing — cancer.” Nowhere does it warn that studies of cell lines or animals don’t prove a human benefit. Combinations of plant chemicals have become a focus of cancer research, driven by their relative safety, low cost, and wide availability. Lab studies have found substances in plants can reduce inflammation, stimulate the immune system, protect and repair normal cells, and slow the growth of cancer cells, among other things. But research on the effects of these substances to fight specific cancers is still in its infancy, and most experts advise eating a wide variety of fruits and vegetables for better health. Prostate cancer is an area where men feel particularly vulnerable because it’s widespread — about 3 million American men are living with prostate cancer, according to the National Cancer Institute — and there are few actionable steps for prevention.

Importantly, the story notes significant side effects attributable to the surgeries, and the struggle to receive insurance coverage. Yet, readers will likely want more information about the study–for example, how old the children were, and what kind of neurosurgery they had. Editor’s note: After initial publication of this review, we changed the rating under Quantify Benefits from Not Satisfactory to Satisfactory. The star rating was changed from 3 stars to 4 stars. This also affected the headline, which we have since updated. See the related criterion below. Surgical approaches to intractable seizure disorders — with some children and adults experiencing hundreds of significant seizures a day — have been shown to improve quality of life and maintain cognitive health, particularly in young children for whom brain plasticity is stronger than in adults. Thus, clinical trials to better clarify both the benefits and the harms of such surgeries worldwide are important in improving the evidence base for these procedures.",true,"""The initial trial of anti-epilepsy surgery in a child demonstrated significant advantages.""","The study discussed in the article presents the outcomes of a trial on neurosurgical interventions for children under 18 with drug-resistant epilepsy.

608,608,13890,"A shocking 20 veteran are committing suicide each and every day , especially our older veteran .","Trump said, ""A shocking 20 veterans are committing suicide each and every day, especially our older veterans."" His claim is supported by recent research by the VA.	Sean Gorman	Topping Donald Trump’s 10-point plan to help U.S. military veterans is a pledge to improve their mental health services. """"A shocking 20 veterans are committing suicide each and every day, especially our older veterans,"""" the presumptive GOP presidential nominee said during a July 11 speech in Virginia Beach, where he excoriated the Department of Veterans Affairs and laid out reforms. We wondered whether Trump’s sad suicide number is correct. His campaign pointed us to research the VA released on July 7 in advance of the agency’s planned publication this month of its most comprehensive report yet on veteran suicides. The VA examined about 55 million veterans records from 1979 through 2014. It found that in 2014, the latest year for which figures are available, that 7,403 veterans took their own lives, or an average of about 20 veterans a day. The count updates a much-cited VA estimate that an average of 22 veterans killed themselves each day in 2010. The VA always acknowledged that this old study was limited, because it was based on veterans living in only 21 states. Notably absent were California and Texas - two states with very high veteran populations. The new figure of 20 veteran suicides a day is based on records from every state. The VA said that 65 percent of veterans who took their own lives in 2014 were 50 or older, a finding that jibes with Trump’s statement that the daily suicides especially pertained to """"older veterans."""" For context, it should be noted that 75 percent of the nation’s veterans are 50 or older. On the other hand, the VA found that younger veterans had the highest rate of suicides. Those ages 18 to 29 had a suicide rate of 77 per 100,000 in 2014. Veterans ages 50 to 59, by comparison, had a rate of 39 per 100,000. In all age groups, the VA found that the percentage of veterans who take their lives was substantially higher than that of adults who never served in the military. The rate for non-veterans ages 18 to 29, for example, was 12.8 per 100,000. The rate for non-vets ages 50 to 59 was 18.6 per 100,000. The 2014 suicide rate for all veterans was 35.3 per 100,000; the rate for all adult non-vets was 15.2 per 100,000. After adjusting for differences in age and gender, the VA concluded that veterans have a 21 percent higher risk of suicide than non-serving adults. Is the situation improving? During a July 7 news conference, VA officials were asked whether their research shows that there has been improvement in the veteran suicide problem, since the updated number, 20 deaths a day, was lower than the previous estimate of 22. David Shulkin, the VA’s undersecretary for health, said the department doesn’t view the new number as a sign of progress. Shulkin said the average number of daily suicides may decreasing because the aging population of veterans also is waning. He stressed, however, that the suicide rate for veterans was rising. VA figures show that the veterans suicide rate actually has increased 32 percent since 2001. That compares with a 23 percent increase in the rate for non-vets during the same period. According to the new report, the suicide rate among veterans who used VA services increased 8.8 percent since 2001, while the rate among veterans who didn’t use those services increased 38.6 percent. Critics have said focusing on the daily number of veteran suicides is pointless and that attention should be fixed on examining the veteran suicide rate and how it compares with the rest of the country. Shulkin, during the news conference, said the daily suicide rate figure has become so """"ingrained"""" in public conversation that the VA decided to recalculate it to ensure it’s correct. Our ruling Trump said, """"A shocking 20 veterans are committing suicide each and every day, especially our older veterans.""""

634,634,11057,"Oregano , Thyme May Hold the Cure for Wasting Syndrome Disease","This release suffers from over-reach and obfuscation — a bad combination. The release cites some pre-clinical animal research at the University of Iowa that suggests that components of the spices oregano and thyme may represent a “cure” for cachexia, a wasting disease that affects cancer patients and others with debilitating diseases. Unfortunately, readers aren’t told that the research was in mice — not humans — until very late in the release. There’s no information on whether the research has been published, or met any other form of peer review. (When we asked to see the study, the media relations team at the university declined and told us the research hadn’t been published.) The spice compounds referred to aren’t named, nor are cost or potential harms addressed. The release doesn’t explain who funded the research or disclose that the university has applied for a patent on the compound. It doesn’t note that the researcher quoted in the release is listed as the inventor on the patent application and would likely stand to benefit financially from its commercialization. The release does note that a pharmaceutical firm has been licensed to market a drug based on the research. Editor’s note: This news release raised serious questions about oversight of the University of Iowa’s research-related communications to the public. We blogged about those questions here but have yet to receive a satisfactory response from the university media relations team. Update 8/24/17: A response received from the university, more than two weeks after the initial request, raises additional serious questions about the university’s process for promoting research, which critics termed “utterly irresponsible.” We wrote about it here. Cachexia is a serious condition typified by chronic weight loss that can affect a patient’s nutritional status and ability to undergo or continue treatment. Striking those with chronic diseases, it weakens patients and in some cases can hasten their demise. If it could be thwarted by compounds from spices, that would represent a real boon. But this release — and the research it reports — does not provide readers with valid and adequate information. Unfortunately, it may play on the hopes of those afflicted with cachexia and their families, offering false hopes instead of new findings.",false,"""Oregano, a subclass and instance of Thyme, could potentially be a cure for Wasting Syndrome Disease.""","The research mentioned in the release is based on pre-clinical studies conducted on mice at the University of Iowa.

Although distressing, launching a family into financial disaster is an adverse outcome as well. This particular story focuses on the increasing cost of 2nd or 3rd-line chemotherapy drugs aimed at advanced cancer. The story notes that patients are often forced to choose between these treatments and their financial savings. The story explains that because the market for  certain drugs is small and focused, the cost of these chemotherapy drugs is higher. The story appropriately notes that cost should be discussed as an additional side effect of treatment. The story notes via an American Cancer Society rep that it ""costs a billion dollars"" to bring a drugs to market; however, we are not told of the typical profit made from these drugs once they are available to patients. This is an oversight in reporting about cost. There is also considerable debate about the validity of that claim about pharma’s R&D costs – which the story does not address. The story does not discuss how these newer drugs work, or how much quantity and quality of life they add to patients’ lives. The story does not discuss if newer drugs are any better than older drugs for treating cancer. We are told that some newer drugs have fewer or different side effects.

639,639,9838,Gene test could spare woman from unnecessary radiation,"Women diagnosed with small breast tumors known as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) often have to make treatment decisions (including whether to add radiation therapy after surgery) without being certain about how much risk of a recurrence they really face. This story reports the results of a study that compared the genetic profile of tumors to the long-term cancer recurrence rate in a group of women. The story provides multiple views and useful context. However, most readers would likely assume that treatment decisions that incorporate these test results would offer better health outcomes. This story should have clearly stated that this study was not designed to answer that important question and that follow-up trials will be need to document the health effects of using this test. Predicting risk is one thing. Knowing which treatment is most likely to produce the best outcome for a patient with a certain risk level is a different question. People often confuse the two; so news reports about risk assessment should take special care to point out that improving the ability to predict a patient’s future does not necessarily mean that you can change that future. Eric Winer’s cautious comment was an important part of the story – “he’d like to see additional studies before using the test to advise patients.”",true,"""Gene tests may prevent women from undergoing unnecessary radiation treatment.""","The study compared the genetic profile of tumors to the long-term cancer recurrence rate in women with small breast tumors.

For many, many reasons, diagnosing and treating high blood pressure are good ideas for maintaining health and preventing strokes and heart disease, and the better news is that there are dozens of drugs and lifestyle changes available — some of them very inexpensive — to help people do so. But this story doesn’t explain that the evidence for an association between high blood pressure and vascular dementia, much less Alzheimer’s disease, is so far mostly observational. And perhaps more significantly, the story carries no data at all to support even the claims or strengths/weaknesses of the association. This NPR story missed an opportunity to offer the data and help the public understand more about risk assessment and probabilities of disease related to blood pressure. And it may mislead people into thinking that if they pop a pressure pill each day, they will avoid Alzheimer’s Disease.

677,677,9475,A New Therapy May Cure Kids of Peanut Allergy,"The story focuses on a long-term follow-up study of patients with peanut allergies who had received immunotherapy and probiotics to minimize allergic response to peanuts. A story in a nationwide publication that suggests there may be a “cure” for peanut allergies — such as the story we are reviewing here — would likely raise hopes for families and individuals living with peanut allergies. But those hopes would be unfounded. The research this story was based on involved fewer than 50 patients, only 24 of whom received the relevant treatment — something the story doesn’t tell readers. And the treatment was not universally successful at eliminating peanut allergy even for those 24 patients. What’s more, there is no discussion in the story of costs or risks associated with treatment. The word “cure” should never be used hastily, something we just pointed out about a different TIME story last week. The NIH states that “peanut allergy is a growing health problem for which no treatment or cure exists. People living with peanut allergy, and their caregivers, must be vigilant about the foods they eat and the environments they enter to avoid allergic reactions, which can be severe and even life-threatening.” A 2010 study stated that 1.4 percent of people in the U.S. report having an allergy to peanuts or tree nuts. In short, peanut allergy poses very real risks for those with peanut allergies, and can pose a particular challenge for parents of children with peanut allergies — who have to maintain constant vigilance regarding the possibility of peanut contamination in places where their kids eat, play or attend school. As a result, new research findings related to addressing peanut allergies garner a lot of attention. This story may leave readers with more questions than answers.",false,"""New therapy could potentially treat children suffering from peanut allergies.""","The study discussed in the article focused on a long-term follow-up of patients with peanut allergies who underwent immunotherapy and probiotics to reduce their allergic response to peanuts.

The treatment did not guarantee the elimination of peanut allergy for all patients, and the article did not mention the associated costs or risks. Therefore, while the study shows promise, it is essential to approach the idea of a ""cure"" for peanut allergies with caution and further research is needed to validate these findings.","[{'subject': 'peanut allergies', 'predicate': 'has effect', 'object': 'children suffering from peanut allergies'}, {'subject': 'peanut allergies', 'predicate': 'has part', 'object': 'children'}, {'subject': 'peanut allergies', 'predicate': 'subclass of', 'object': 'children suffering from peanut allergies'}]",[],"[{'subject': 'therapy', 'predicate': 'treat from', 'object': 'children'}]"

692,692,9909,Hip resurfacing aimed at boomer,"The AP news story does a nice job of explaining what hip resurfacing is and how it fits into the history of hip replacement procedures. It summarizes the current availability of hip resurfacing in the US. However, the story provides virtually no evidence on the efficacy of resurfacing to support the mostly glowing testimonials of the three surgeons it quotes. According to the news article, the FDA “cited studies showing the Birmingham Hip resurfacer lasted at least five years…” What sorts of studies did the FDA analyze? What about the rest of the outcomes that patients value—such as improvements in pain and activity? Are there any randomized trials that compare similar patients who have undergone resurfacing with patients who have undergone total hip replacement? Is there follow-up beyond five years? These questions remain unanswered. The discussion of harms is likewise incomplete. The news article points out that hip resurfacing isn’t for everyone, and mentions two groups in whom it might not be appropriate. But the available research suggests the picture may be more complicated. There is disagreement about whether the procedure impairs the blood supply to bone or generates so much heat that it could cause the death of thigh bone. Bone death (necrosis of the femoral head) is a devastating complication for which there is currently no good solution. Other studies suggest additional potential problems. (For references and more details on potential harms, see “Harms of Treatment” above.) Although it is true that some researchers have found few problems with the devices and reported great success, readers deserve to know where the uncertainties lie. Perhaps the greatest uncertainty has to do with how long the implants will hold up. Though sufficient for FDA approval, survival of “at least five years” is not a strong endorsement. Total joint replacement, by comparison, has a track record extending 15 to 25 years. A closer look at the evidence might have reshaped the take-home message from this news report.",mixture,"""Hip resurfacing is a procedure specifically targeted at the boomer generation.""","The explanation provided in the news article about hip resurfacing lacks evidence on its efficacy, long-term outcomes, and potential harms.

Over the course of the past decade, evidence has been accumulating that the compound 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), better known as ecstasy, may be more effective than current drugs such as Zoloft and Paxil. This story, jump-started by a recent decision by the Food and Drug Administration to classify MDMA as a “breakthrough drug,” which allows it to be evaluated and possibly approved more quickly, offers the reader a well-written account of the evolution of MDMA from a bad actor to a potentially efficacious one. An important element of the narrative is the dominant role of a nonprofit organization, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, which is dedicated to ending government bans on psychedelic substances and marijuana and has funded virtually all of the extant research on MDMA’s impact on PTSD sufferers. While the story is well-sourced, the text fails to explore this conflict of interest. It also may land too heavily on the side of “probable” rather than “possible.” The headline—Ecstasy could be “breakthrough” therapy for soldiers, others suffering from PTSD—is worded conditionally but clearly heralds the dawn of a new age. Given the long clinical trial road ahead, despite MDMA’s “breakthrough” status designation, much could change. The substance MDMA may meet all evidentiary challenges and emerge at some point in the future as an effective part of the treatment regimen for PTSD.

The story mentions this was a mouse study and acknowledges it isn’t the only potential avenue under study to arrest those harmful substances. However, it gives an overly optimistic spin, using the word “promising” and playing up a speculative comment in a UT Southwestern Medical Center news release that dementia cases “could drop by half” if there’s a vaccine that delays the onset of Alzheimer’s by five years. The story also doesn’t caution that success in animals often doesn’t translate to benefits in humans, and that other treatments targeting these proteins have not panned out. Also missing: discussions of costs and potential harms and comments from independent sources. As the U.S. population ages, dementia is becoming more common. Millions of families are coping with a person who has a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s. Available treatments do not prevent or cure Alzheimer’s and at best slow down the progression of symptoms for short periods. Considerable effort has focused on new treatments that seek to break down or prevent the deposition of abnormal proteins that appear to increase as memory loss progresses. So far these new treatments have not been shown to help. Initially they were tried in individuals with advanced disease but now are being used in patients with mild symptoms as a way to prevent progression. Even here, trials have not shown positive results that are clinically meaningful. A vaccine to “prevent” Alzheimer’s is appealing in that it works even earlier in the process, maybe even before symptoms appear. However, it isn’t clear that a vaccine will actually improve clinical outcomes. The fact that this small study in mice led to several optimistic headlines — not just USA Today’s — reflects how desperate we are for progress.

The study was published in the British Medical Journal Open. Commendably, the release used mostly cautious language, stating the study adds “new evidence in support of midwives as a safe option.” However, it did not quantify adequately the differences in the outcomes or explain the limitations of observational data. Midwifery can fill an important need for wider access to care for pregnant women. Advocates for midwives say they reduce unnecessary care, cost less, and lead to great patient satisfaction. Still, news releases should stress the need for ongoing research to assess how the use of midwives affects pregnancy outcomes. The research report describes the study’s context well, noting that at this stage in the evolution of midwifery care in Canada, a randomized trial could not be supported based on the limited evidence that midwifery care is at least as good as traditional care.

The release flogs the myth that early detection is always a good thing, thus raising false hopes. To give powerful cancer treatments too soon, or even unnecessarily, does enormous harm, justified only if the potential benefit is clear. Not only does this study of the ONCOblot test fail to provide any evidence that early detection could provide a benefit to people exposed to asbestos (most of whom will never get mesothelioma), the retrospective study of a few people who have been diagnosed with mesothelioma cannot even demonstrate that the test could reliably predict who is likely to develop the disease, something that will have to be tested by prospective studies.

746,746,9216,Final trial result confirm Ebola vaccine provides high protection against disease,"This news release discusses the results of a World Health Organization-led study of an experimental Ebola vaccine manufactured by Merck, Sharpe & Dohme. The study tested the effectiveness of the vaccine (currently referred to as rVSV-ZEBOV) among individuals who had come in contact with people diagnosed with Ebola within three weeks prior to the diagnosis, including contacts of those contacts, using a “ring vaccination” approach similar to that used to fight smallpox in the mid- to late 20th century. Among the 5,837 individuals who were vaccinated immediately after assignment to the study, none developed Ebola 10 days or more after being enrolled. In comparison, there were 23 Ebola cases identified 10 days or more in the group of 4,507 assigned to either a delayed vaccination (16 cases) or no vaccination (7 cases). The release delivers a good description of harms, is written in a balanced and non-sensational tone, and provides an overview of next steps for the vaccine. The release would have been improved with some reference to cost and the other Ebola vaccines under development by major pharmaceutical competitors. Health organizations worldwide have been scrambling to develop an effective vaccine against Ebola since the 2013-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa which killed more than 11,300 people. Merck received “Breakthrough Therapy Designation” status in 2016 from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and “PRIME” status from the European Medicines Agency for this closely watched vaccine.

760,760,10640,Drug may delay high blood pressure in some,"This article discusses a recent New England Journal of Medicine article on a randomized, controlled, double-blinded trial of candesartan, an Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker (ARB), to prevent hypertension in prehypertensive patients. Candesartan works by blocking the action of a substance in the body that causes blood vessels to tighten. As a result, candesartan relaxes blood vessels and this lowers blood pressure. There is evidence of disease mongering in this story: The classification of “prehypertension” (systolic 130-139 mm Hg and 85-89 mm Hg diastolic) is still debatable by some medical experts, and whether prehypertension alone is a strong predictor of future heart disease is also debatable. Blood pressure increases as a natural part of aging, so whether prehypertension or mild hypertension should be viewed as a condition or disease and treated with costly medication needs further study. Hypertension is only one of several risk factors that contributes to heart disease. A prehypertensive or mildly hypertensive person with low risk factors and a healthy lifestyle may not benefit from drug treatment as much as someone with greater risk of heart disease and an unhealthy behaviors, such as a poor diet, lack of exercise and smoking. The story does mention lifestyle modifications, such as diet and exercise, as a “cornerstone of controlling blood pressure,” however, comparison is only anecdotal and there is no mention of studies examining the effect of lifestyle modification on prehypertension or hypertension. The story mentions limiting salt and water as part of lifestyle modification. A reduced sodium diet may help control hypertension, but reducing water will not help most people decrease blood pressure. There is not much quantitative information on the risk reduction from taking an ARB to prevent hypertension. There was some modest protective benefit in the treatment group at 4 years (absolute reduction 9.8%), though the story says those who took the drug for 2 years and then a placebo for an additional 2 years “matched the placebo group”. There is no discussion of the side effects of this anti-hypertensive drug, nor is there discussion of long-term safety of taking this medication for many years as a means of prevention. The most common side effects of ARBs are cough, elevated potassium levels, low blood pressure, dizziness, headache, drowsiness, diarrhea, abnormal taste sensation (metallic or salty taste), and rash. In this study, gastrointestinal problems, dizziness and headaches were more common in the treatment group, though in most cases, the difference was small. This class of drugs are typically more expensive than other anti-hypertensive medications, but there is no mention of the cost of taking this medication daily for prevention of hypertension. Also, there is no comparison of ARB treatment with less costly anti-hypertensive medications such a diuretics, or a cost comparison with lifestyle modification. Lastly, the story appropriately notes that the makers of the candesartan sponsored and help design the study. What is not mentioned is that the lead author also serves as a consultant to the drug company and has other grant support from AstraZeneca, the makers of the drug.",false,"""Some individuals may experience a delay in the onset of high blood pressure when using a specific drug for treatment.""","The drug candesartan, an Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker (ARB), can help prevent hypertension in prehypertensive patients by relaxing blood vessels and lowering blood pressure.

764,764,10755,Chinese herb may yield drug for AIDS,"This story is about bevirimat, a new drug for late stage HIV. While there is interesting background on the current stage of HIV/AIDS drug development in the story, it has several important flaws. The story provides no evidence on the safety or efficacy of this drug, despite the drug company president’s comments that bevirimat “. . .looks potent and has a great safety profile”. What is the evidence? The story does not discuss the potential side effects of this new drug, and it does not provide a caveat that the drug may not live up to its predicted effect in humans. The story mentions that this new drug would be taken in combination with current antiretroviral therapies. But there is no discussion of any possible negative interaction(s) with other HIV drugs, or with drugs for co-existing medical conditions. Researchers and physicians who work with HIV/AIDS therapies are cited to provide perspective on this potential new treatment in the context of current therapies. Sources who are also paid consultants for Panacos Pharmaceuticals are appropriately noted. Some appropriate attempt at balance is provided by the concluding quote from Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health. There is one error in the article: “People who started AIDS therapy in 2003 lived an estimated 13 years longer than people diagnosed with AIDS in 1988.” Presumably they meant that people starting treatment in 2003 are EXPECTED to live 13 yrs longer. The story provides appropriate prevalence and incidence data on Americans living with HIV. If anything, the story under-reports HIV prevalence worldwide. The story might have aked the question: If this therapy is approved, would it be made available to the millions infected with HIV in developing countries?

774,774,9270,Injected Drug Reduces Risk of Fracture among Women with Osteoporosis,"There’s so much to like about this news release. In particular, it does a wonderful and economical job summarizing the benefits of the drugs being studied. It provides the numbers in both absolute and relative terms, for example. But it skimps on some of the details, chiefly the costs of the drugs, that the funder of the study makes one of the drugs in question, and whether the drugs are experimental or on the market. Osteoporosis is a well-known risk factor for fracture, especially among older women. It can also be screened for with x-rays that measure bone density. A number of different treatments exist for individuals with osteoporosis and this news release presents data from a published study in JAMA. For most individuals with osteoporosis, calcium and vitamin D supplements are recommended if dietary consumption isn’t adequate. First-line medications to decrease fracture risk is a group called the bisphosphonates. These medicines have been around for several decades and are usually taken by mouth on a weekly basis or by injection once a year. For individuals who are at particularly high risk, including those who have had a fracture while taking a bisphosphonate, second-line therapy is considered. These medicines include teriparatides that are given as a daily injection under the skin. The current study compares a new version of this class of drug, abaloparatide, to placebo and teriparatide. As a related editorial highlights, there are a number of effective medicines to prevent fractures in those with osteoporosis and they are probably under-used. For most individuals, use of existing oral medicines should be the focus of initial treatment. The current study focuses on giving patients who didn’t respond to the initial therapy or other high risk individuals another option.",mixture,"""The injected drug is known to decrease the likelihood of fractures in women suffering from osteoporosis.""","The drug discussed in the news release reduces the risk of fracture among women with osteoporosis.

Finding cancer at an early stage via a blood test may improve survival rates, and reduce the need for invasive biopsies.

781,781,10910,New drug ‘ may turn back the clock on heart disease ’,"This was an overly enthusiastic account of a study on an experimental new drug called anacetrapib that lowers bad cholesterol and raises good cholesterol. The study was designed to look primarily at the safety of the drug and not whether it prevented heart attacks. But that didn’t prevent the story from making some wildly positive statements about the likely benefits of treatment. The story stumbles out of the gate with an over-the-top prediction about how the drug “may conquer heart disease.”  It continues to lay on the hype with quotes about the “incredible” results and how the drug could be “the perfect new treatment for all people at risk of a heart attack.” We realize some of this enthusiasm came from the mouths of experts but we know there are many who would be far more cautious and we didn’t hear from them in the story. It closes with an erroneous description of how many people died in the study. Needless to say, not what we hope to see on the front page of the nation’s highest-circulating daily. By comparison, look at how NPR closed their online story: “Still there were four deaths from cardiovascular causes among the 800 patients taking Merck’s drug compared with just one among the same number in the the just-released trial results. So don’t count Merck’s drug approved just yet.” (Please note: we reviewed the first version of each story that we found – not any subsequent versions the news orgs may have published. In fact, the version we reviewed doesn’t even appear online anymore.) It would nice if preventing heart attacks was just a matter of lowering bad cholesterol and raising good cholesterol. However, research increasingly suggests that it isn’t as simple as that. Drugs that lower bad cholesterol through one mechanism do appear to be effective, but drugs that lower it another way may not offer the same protection. Similarly, people with naturally high good cholesterol seem to have a low risk of heart attacks, but not every drug that raises good cholesterol has cardiovacular benefits. (In fact, another experimental drug that raises good cholesterol was shown recently to increase the risk of heart attacks.) So far, the drug discussed in this story doesn’t appear to have the same problems as its good cholesterol-raising predecessor, but at this early stage of development we simply don’t know if it works. Larger studies might show that the drug has safety problems that haven’t shown up in this study. Or it might turn out that the drug is safe but doesn’t offer much protection. Some drugs even get approved only to later be recalled because of rare but serious adverse effects that aren’t apparent until millions of people start taking the medicine. This is all a way of saying that caution is required when a drug is this early in its development.

If this device described in the release, called a volumetric impedance phase shift spectroscopy (VIPS), could help emergency personnel determine where to take patients with suspected stroke for treatment (a comprehensive stroke center or a primary stroke center) then it might be very valuable. The release describes a published study on the VIPS diagnostic tool showing that it can accurately detect large-vessel occlusion (a blockage or closing of a blood vessel) in patients with suspected stroke yet it misses some of the key features you’d expect with a news release talking about a new diagnostic tool, especially its cost, and its accuracy measured against other methods, such as a mobile CT scan, to differentiate strokes. If care could be improved by a speedier, easy to use device which helps decide whether endovascular therapy (a procedure used to treat problems affecting the blood vessels) is necessary this could well improve outcomes for stroke patients. Researchers at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), Mount Sinai, the University of Tennessee Health Sciences Center and elsewhere published a study in the Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery suggesting that their device (a visor worn by emergency personnel) called a volumetric impedance phase shift spectroscopy (VIPS) was better at identifying patients with large-vessel occlusions than a standard physical examination. This matters because if the device passes all the other tests we expect of diagnostic tools including showing it’s sufficiently sensitive and specific and an improvement over other methods, then it could more quickly route patients to stroke centers that have endovascular capabilities and have a large impact on the outcome of patients.",mixture,"""The portable device can identify a severe stroke within seconds with an accuracy of 92 percent.""","The VIPS device, a portable tool described in the study, has shown promising results in accurately detecting large-vessel occlusion in patients with suspected stroke.

While a competing HealthDay story took pains to point out the tentative nature of the study, this Time piece gives readers a cursory and overly optimistic view of its potential. Alzheimer’s dementia is a debilitating and increasingly prevalent condition in our aging society. If the described simple, non-invasive screening test is truly effective (which will take much more testing to find out), it could have an enormous impact that is potentially positive if we develop better treatments for Alzheimer’s patients and can take action based on the results.

While the column does a nice job of pointing out some of the limitations of the studies included in the review and highlights the fact the review authors cannot make a recommendation for the dosage or preparation, it missed the mark on a few key points. For instance, there was no discussion of costs, (which seems like an important omission, as many readers will want to try the over-the-counter products), there was little mention of the adverse effects of zinc, and there was no commentary from an independent expert. Although most of us view the common cold as a mere nuisance, the infection can have serious clinical and economic impact. The common cold is responsible for a large number of lost work days, lost school days and physician visits. Over $400 million is spent annually in the US for over-the-counter remedies. Unfortunately, the common cold is also responsible for significant number of prescriptions for antibiotics despite the fact that antibiotics do not work against viral infections. The common cold can also trigger ear infections, sinusitis and worsen lung disease.

800,800,9298,Metformin may lower lung cancer risk in diabetic nonsmoker,"This release reports on an NIH-funded study to determine if the use of the drug metformin by diabetic patients may affect their risk of developing lung cancer. The overall answer is that it does not, but the release takes five paragraphs to say that. Instead, it focuses on a very small subset of patients who had never smoked and whose lung cancer risk appeared to be lower than never-smokers who didn’t take metformin. By trumpeting findings from that subgroup — and burying the main results of the study, which were negative — this release misrepresents the research findings and misleads its readers. We’d suggest that the findings of this study probably did not warrant the spotlight provided by a news release. But if a news release is to be issued, it should lead with the results for the primary outcome and give second billing to provocative but preliminary findings from subgroups. While not as egregious as another example of subgroup “spin” that we recently reported on, this news release will certainly give readers the impression that there’s something special about metformin when it comes to preventing cancer in people with diabetes, when that hasn’t been established with any certainty. Diabetes is a chronic disease requiring long-term use of drugs such as metformin. Some research suggests that metformin may decrease the risk of lung cancer — making the results of this study an important addition to the scientific literature. Unfortunately, the release focuses almost entirely on the results seen in a small subgroup of patients. As such, it doesn’t accurately reflect the totality of the research in question. Subgroup findings can be included, but should never supersede the main outcome.",mixture,"""Metformin, a drug used for treating lung cancer, may reduce the risk of this disease in diabetic nonsmokers.""","The study investigated the potential impact of metformin on lung cancer risk in diabetic patients.

The main section doesn’t even allude to evidence, other than to state that more research is to be done, which is true about most everything in medicine except limes for scurvy. As far as a reader can tell, the “new portable scanner” may have yet to leave a laboratory setting. All we know is that it’s been submitted to, and is a finalist for, an engineering & technology award. It’s not the same as clinical research. The article is quick to point out mammography’s low detection rates (sensitivity, perhaps?) in younger women, identifying the problem to be solved, but it never tells us the detection rates for the new tool. The data very well may be unknown. Which means detection rates could be worse! But from the structure of this article, focusing on technology but not evidence, a reader could only conclude the new kid on the block is superior. If we’re lucky, the new kid will make the world a better place. But filing a patent for a device is not the same level of proof as clinical research. People would be shocked to learn how many promising ideas from labs and napkins never survive clinical trials, how many prove to be worse for mankind than what we already do. Science is hard and complex. Last year’s uproar over the new mammography guidelines highlighted that there are important subtleties about screening for cancer, and that clear, balanced communication is crucial. It may sound like we ask a lot of journalists. But really, asking one more question would’ve turned this story around: How far along is this idea? The answer leads us to look beyond the novelty, beyond the theoretical benefits, beyond the entangled claims of the institution and inventor who stand to benefit, and see, simply, whether this idea is better or worse or needs 4 more years in the oven before we can even ask. Mammography isn’t perfect, and an improved screening technique for breast cancer could reduce pain, suffering, and death for many women. But that need doesn’t give journalists a license to hype.",false,"""The new portable scanner is a device specifically designed for breast cancer detection.""","The research on the new portable scanner for breast cancer is still in the early stages, as indicated by its submission for an engineering & technology award.

Curcumin is a bright yellow compound found in the spice tumeric. The news release doesn’t disclose any harms and quantitative data to back up its claims and, instead, uses only broad, ambiguous language when describing the treatment’s benefits. For example, researchers found that these molecules may induce “substantial” cell death in neuroblastoma cells without being toxic to healthy cells. The study’s limitations should have been emphasized — namely, that it’s early pre-clinical research with experiments only conducted in undefined cell lines. In addition, research with curcumin-loaded nanoparticles isn’t exactly new. In 2012, a couple of studies looked at the molecule’s effects, including its toxicity, on neuroblastoma cells. Many news releases cover research that is in its pre-clinical phases. This is fair game, of course, but we then expect these reports to caution readers on the treatment’s applicability to clinical medicine. In other words, treatments that are successful in cell lines and animal models usually do not translate to effective clinical outcomes. Furthermore, it also takes years, maybe decades, before a treatment is even ready for clinical trials — a process often referred to as “from bench to bedside.” To avoid giving patients false hope, news releases need to disclose the early nature of the research high up in the release as well as be more explicit in detailing the treatment’s development and timeline.",false,"""Nanoparticles, which are instances of common spice, have an effect on cancer cells, leading to their death.""","The study discussed in the news release found that nanoparticles loaded with curcumin, a component of turmeric, have the potential to induce significant cell death in neuroblastoma tumor cells.

831,831,11229,Pre and Post Testing Show Reversal of Memory Loss From Alzheimer ’ s Disease in Ten Patients,"This is a news release about an update of a small 2014 study on a program to reverse cognitive impairment associated with Alzheimer’s disease. The program includes as many as 36 interventions which must be followed. Right out of the starting gate the release misinforms by using the terms mild cognitive impairment, subjective cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease interchangeably. They are not the same. The study reports “unprecedented” improvement in 10 patients with “early Alzheimer’s (AD) or its precursors” who adhered to the protocol, dubbed “metabolic enhancement for neurodegeneration,” or MEND, for five to 24 months. All but one of the patients had genes (APOE) associated with Alzheimer’s. The news release provides data on just three of the cases in the study and does not discuss costs or potential challenges of adhering to this protocol. The news release reveals that the developer of the program, University of California, Los Angeles neurology professor Dale Bredesen, M.D., has a deal to publish a book for lay readers in 2017. Moreover, researchers say their findings are strong enough to warrant widespread genetic testing so those at risk for the disease can receive preventive measures. The book deal and the recommendation of genetic testing are troubling since there are just a handful of case studies to back up the program. Bredesen himself is quoted in the news release acknowledging the need for large-scale clinical trials. But the minor use of cautious language in describing the study as “small” and the call for future larger trials do not make up for the intentional muddying of the symptoms of age-related memory loss and Alzheimer’s disease. As the news release points out, Alzheimer’s disease is a huge and growing problem, affecting 5.4 million Americans and creating an economic burden on the health care system. No medications are available to stop its progress. There’s evidence that non-drug interventions that are designed to fight inflammation and improve blood sugar regulation like those in the MEND program could be effective. The MEND program includes the elimination of processed foods, regular exercise, yoga and medication to reduce stress, melatonin to extend sleep, supplements such as fish oil, vitamins D3 and B12, and hormone replacement therapy. However, the MEND treatment protocol involves so many factors it may be difficult to determine which ones are effective. To date nothing has been proven to prevent Alzheimer’s. Medications are available but they are expensive, may delay progression marginally, and have side effects.",false,"""Ten patients showed a reversal in Alzheimer's Disease-induced memory loss through pre and post testing.""","The study reported unprecedented improvement in 10 patients with early Alzheimer's disease or its precursors who followed the metabolic enhancement for neurodegeneration (MEND) protocol for five to 24 months.

This brief article explains why a certain subset of people who have strokes may be treated more effectively with a new procedure than with existing alternatives. The new procedure sends a thin wire tube through their blood vessels to the location of a clot in the brain and removes it. The story did an excellent job of listing the complex criteria required to find the patients for whom this procedure is now recommended. It could have provided more specifics about the benefits associated with the procedure and its costs. And one of the experts tapped for commentary is a paid consultant to companies who make the devices used in this procedure, and the story should have alerted readers to that fact. The new guidelines are the result of months of study by a committee of the American Heart Association. Implementation of these guidelines will require much more systematic coordination of stroke care than currently exists. Currently, smaller community hospitals can quickly assess a patient, get an imaging study, and start tPA (clot-busting medication delivered by IV) within an hour or two after symptoms begin. But to assess eligibility for endovascular clot retrieval (the procedure discussed here), and transport patients to centers that provide the highly specialized procedures, could take time. There is good-quality evidence that such coordination of stroke care would produce clinically important benefits, but the logistical and cost challenges that have yet to be addressed are significant.",true,"""The Heart Association's Stroke Guidelines endorse the use of a clot-removing device, which can be utilized to extract blockages through the artery if clot-busting drugs prove ineffective.""",The new guidelines from the American Heart Association recommend using a Medtronic device to remove clots during a stroke if clot-busting drugs are ineffective.

853,853,11332,Researchers Develop Simple Paper Test That Quickly Diagnoses Illnesses by Changing Colour,"Paper diagnostic test strip. Image: McMaster UniversityThis news release reports on the development of paper test strips that amplify DNA or RNA from blood, sweat or urine and determine if the person taking the test has a disease. The strips are made of a polymeric sugar film integrated with the paper device. Once a sample is applied the paper changes color to indicate the presence of a marker for a “specific bacterium, virus, or even cancer,” according to the release. The researchers quoted in the release claim that these test strips can be easily and inexpensively manufactured and, because they are portable, could be used to diagnose or self-diagnose illness (such as Ebola) in remote areas before the subject even knows they are ill. But the release does not make clear how such a test could be used to diagnose and differentiate between the multitudes of different diseases and conditions that afflict humans. Besides skirting other important details such as ballpark cost of the strips and data backing up claimed benefits, the release doesn’t put the paper test in context. While the idea of a “simple” paper test to check for illness may sound novel to the public, paper diagnostic tools have been under development since at least 2007. Some diseases are contagious long before the patient has any symptoms. If a person could be diagnosed as contagious in an asymptomatic stage, then the spread of infection could be slowed or halted. A rapid test allowing patients tested in a clinic to know before they left if they had influenza or a cold, strep or a viral sore throat, would be advantageous because it would allow faster targeted treatments. Because such a diagnostic tools are predicted to be relatively inexpensive, portable, and easy to use, they might also hold enormous potential for helping health professionals in the developing world to quickly and accurately diagnose and treat disease.",false,"""A simple paper test has been developed by researchers, which diagnoses illnesses by changing color.""","The development of paper test strips allows for the quick diagnosis of illnesses by detecting specific markers for bacteria, viruses, or cancer in bodily fluids.

The 5-year survival rate for MCC is estimated at around 60 percent, according to MayoClinic.org. This is the first drug approved for treating MCC — but not the only recognized treatment for the disease. Some of the media interest in the approval relates to the rapidity with which the FDA approved it while awarding the drug several special designations — accelerated approval, priority review, breakthrough therapy and orphan drug status, the latter of which “provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases,” according to the FDA’s news release on the approval.

864,864,10620,Landmark clinical trial show gene-targeted drug can treat prostate cancer,"This small phase ll study looked at responses to the drug olarparib, and its action on a particular type of prostate tumor mutation. While the news release indicates that this is pioneering work in the field of personalized prostate cancer treatment, there is still much to be skeptical about the practice of isolating cancer-related genes with new targeted drugs. The key point not made in the news release is that the study did not demonstrate any mortality or survival benefit in the act of identifying and targeting men with mutated prostate tumors and giving them olarparib. The news release comes across somewhat as a promotional vehicle for genetic testing and yet comparing it with the test for BRAC (breast cancer susceptibility gene) mutation would tend to give it a gloss it might not deserve. Without results with this form of  “precision medicine,” hyping genetic testing around this type of metastatic prostate cancer feels a little irresponsible. The final line: “Understanding the link between prostate cancer and DNA repair mutations is incredibly important for patients and their families” seems to be putting the cart way before the horse and is likely to confuse and build unreasonable expectations among prostate cancer sufferers. Many men still die from prostate cancer and if there were an easy genetic test that could pinpoint which prostate cancer sufferers were most likely to benefit from a targeted drug therapy this could be a huge advance. The news release presents hype and hope yet one has to refer to the published study to find any real information, where the researchers report: “We cannot yet determine whether olaparib improves overall survival among patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer and DNA-repair defects.”",false,"""A landmark clinical trial has demonstrated that prostate cancer can be treated with a gene-targeted drug.""","The study focused on the drug olaparib and its effectiveness on a specific type of prostate tumor mutation.

The promotion of genetic testing for this type of cancer without concrete results in precision medicine may lead to unrealistic expectations among patients. The importance of understanding the connection between prostate cancer and DNA repair mutations is emphasized, but it is crucial to await further research to determine the actual benefits of olaparib in treating metastatic prostate cancer with DNA-repair defects.","[{'subject': 'landmark clinical trial', 'predicate': 'facet of', 'object': 'prostate cancer'}, {'subject': 'landmark clinical trial', 'predicate': 'main subject', 'object': 'prostate cancer'}, {'subject': 'prostate cancer', 'predicate': 'drug used for treatment', 'object': 'gene-targeted drug'}, {'subject': 'gene-targeted drug', 'predicate': 'medical condition treated', 'object': 'prostate cancer'}]","[{'subject': 'prostate cancer', 'predicate': 'be treated with', 'object': 'targeted drug'}, {'subject': 'prostate cancer', 'predicate': 'be treated with', 'object': 'drug'}, {'subject': 'prostate cancer', 'predicate': 'be', 'object': 'treated'}, {'subject': 'prostate cancer', 'predicate': 'be treated with', 'object': 'gene targeted drug'}]",[]

867,867,10592,New hormone therapy spark debate,"The story presents bioidentical hormones as a new option for relieving bothersome symptoms of menopause such as hot flashes, cold sweats and vaginal discomfort. The story accurately reports that the active ingredients of these supposedly “natural” hormones are the same ones used in synthetic hormone replacement therapy (HRT). However, these hormones are not as well-regulated or well-tested as synthetic versions. The story provides no evidence that bioidentical hormones are more effective or safer than traditional HRT. Positive testimonials from a physician employee of a bioidentical hormone supplier, a celebrity and women who have experienced reduced menopausal symptoms with  bioidentical hormones are not a substitute for quantitative evidence. The comment that a hormone product can be tailored to a woman's chemistry is not proven. Additionally, the story does not mention the cost of bioidenticals, which are typically about $50/month, similar to the cost of conventional HRT. Any physician can provide a prescription for bioidentical hormones in a routine office visit. The story appropriately stresses that menopause is a natural part of aging and not a disease which necessitates medical intervention. The story also mentions that short-term use of HRT in any form should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Unless symptoms are very bothersome, many women do not need to take HRT to ease symptoms common in menopause. While the bioindentical hormones are marketed as a natural alternative to balancing hormones and easing bothersome symptoms of hormonal fluctuations during menopause, the story fails to mention the least risky “natural” interventions for managing symptoms of menopause, such as exercise and wearing loose, cool clothing to prevent discomfort from hot flashes and cold sweats. The story also does not mention non-hormonal, evidence-based pharmaceutical options for managing symptoms. However, using these medications for treatment of hot flashes would be considered an off-label prescription.

It is important to note that menopause is a natural process and not a medical condition requiring intervention. The cost of bioidentical hormones is around $50 per month, similar to conventional HRT. While bioidentical hormones are marketed as a natural solution for hormonal imbalances during menopause, the story overlooks other low-risk natural interventions like exercise and wearing comfortable clothing to manage symptoms.

The research suggests women who opted for surgery to treat their breast cancer had better survival rates than those who didn’t, even though the number of surgeries has plunged from 1988 to 2011. This Washington Post report does many things well: It quantifies the benefits of breast surgery in absolute terms, points out the study’s limitations and doesn’t make sweeping recommendations based on this research. Furthermore, the story uses cautionary language, making readers really question whether surgery is the better option for stage 4 breast cancer patients. It also incorporates two independent sources who provide some critical perspectives, such as the two other small studies that showed no correlation between surgery and survival in this group of women. We would have liked to have seen more discussion on the harms of breast surgeries, as well as the existing therapies for breast cancer patients. And we would have liked for the report to have pointed out that usually younger women underwent surgery in the study, which may have affected the results. Overall, however, the Washington Post puts forth a thorough, nuanced story based on the latest findings. Though current screening recommendations for breast cancer are intended to identify cancers at an earlier, more curable stage of disease, women still present with metastatic disease (cancer that has spread to other parts of the body). This can occur because of not having screening or not having it regularly enough, or it may relate to aggressive disease that develops and metastasizes prior to it being detected on standard imaging tests. For those women with metastatic disease, particularly younger ones, cure and thus long-term survival is uncommon. The question addressed in this story is whether the addition of surgery to standard aggressive therapy – generally chemotherapy and radiation treatment – leads to longer survival. The story does a good job of describing the benefit seen in this retrospective study as well as highlighting its limitations. Specifically, there is no evidence from higher quality, prospective studies that surgery provides additional survival benefit. Clearly such studies are needed and the article suggests that such studies are currently underway. The challenge is what to recommend for women who currently face this treatment decision. The simple answer is that we don’t really know and the article does a good job of not overselling surgery based upon the results of this study.",true,"""According to a study, surgery can prolong the survival of women diagnosed with Stage 4 breast cancer.""","The study published in JAMA Surgery suggests that women with Stage 4 breast cancer who choose surgery for treatment have better survival rates compared to those who do not undergo surgery.

In 2001, the FDA approved the InterStim sacral nerve stimulation system for the treatment of urge incontinence.

It might also have provided more context on treatment harms and alternatives. Can behavioral therapy go wrong—and if it can, how might it harm a vulnerable preschooler?

The release quotes a researcher who hopes “the procedure will be available widely in the near future.” But there’s no evidence to support that statement either. While the release is peppered with claims that this device that combines laser light with ultrasound pulses will be safer and more effective, that’s not what the experiment tested. The researchers showed only that their device was able to push more laser light through a piece of pig skin than a conventional laser. Their assumption that increasing transmitted optical power will improve clinical effectiveness has yet to be tested. Neither benefits nor harms are put in numerical context. Alternatives are not mentioned. We applaud the release writers for including a link to a patent application, which provides more detail about the device and highlights potential benefits to the researchers. The release notes that the work was funded by a program to support commercialization of academic research. There are objective statements about research results, and then there are marketing statements in support of a product. This research was supported by a University of Missouri’s FastTrack grant. According to the university’s web site, such grants “are not to be used for basic research, but to evaluate the commercial potential of existing research.” But when journalists and others receive a news release from University of Missouri Health they should be able to trust that academic standards hold more sway than marketing interests.",false,"""New techniques could revolutionize laser-based dermatological procedures, a subset of dermatological procedures.""","The development of a new device at the University of Missouri aims to enhance laser-based dermatological procedures for removing tattoos, birthmarks, and port-wine stains.

937,937,9253,Discovery offer prospect of shorter treatment and cure for chronic myelogenous leukemia,"This news release by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute is a teaser on a potential new drug target for sufferers of a blood cancer called chronic myelogenous leukemia, or CML, which affects 30,000 Americans a year. The release spends a good amount of space explaining the condition and problems with a standard treatment — a drug called Gleevec (a brand-name version of the drug imatinib) — and how up to 90% of patients with the disease face a lifetime of medication that may eventually stop working. It also does a nice job explaining a biological pathway that helps drive CML and why it might be a mechanism to target in the future, specifically Ezh2 inhibitors. However, the study was done in mice — not people. The release belatedly points this out in the final third of the text — but we would have liked to see it more prominently mentioned. The reason: The relevance may not transfer to people with CML. That’s also why we think the repeated use of the word “cure” and the possibility of shorter treatment in the headline is overstating and misleading. One glaring omission was that of price. The only allusion to price in the news release is an aside in the closing line noting shorter treatment times translate into cost savings. We’re also given no rough treatment cost estimates for an unnamed Ezh2 inhibitor made by Epizyme that’s mentioned in the release. Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) develops in bone marrow and affects myeloid cells. Those cells typically mature into platelets or red blood cells, but genetic and other abnormalities can lead them to mature into defunct granulocyte cells, i.e. leukemia. CML patients experience a gradual though sometimes rapid build-up of leukemia in their bones and then in their spleen, crowding out healthy cells over time. This drives symptoms that may include frequent infections (due to immune system weakening), fatigue (fewer red blood cells), and easy bleeding (fewer platelets). CML affects about 30,000 people each year and about 1.2 million to 1.5 million people worldwide, most of them middle-aged adults (though there are a few children). While patients who seek the standard of treatment — imatinib (marketed as Gleevec and Glivec) — receive it “indefinitely,” the median survival is between 5-6 years, since leukemia cells can build up resistance to imatinib-like drugs. In fact, about 80-90% of patients can’t clear all of their leukemia cells and stay on permanent drugs. By increasing the number of CML patients who can drive their cancer into remission, suffering could be dramatically reduced — as would the cost of their treatment. As teased by this release, Ezh2 inhibitors may (or may not) help CML patients. Clinical trials would have to determine if that hypothesis pans out.",false,"""The discovery of a new drug offers the possibility of a shorter treatment and cure for chronic myelogenous leukemia.""","The Dana-Farber Cancer Institute's news release discusses a potential new drug target for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), a blood cancer affecting 30,000 Americans annually. The release highlights the challenges with current treatment options, such as Gleevec, and introduces the possibility of targeting a biological pathway with Ezh2 inhibitors for future treatments. However, it's important to note that the study was conducted in mice, not humans, which may impact the relevance to CML patients. The use of the word ""cure"" and the promise of shorter treatment times in the headline may be overstated and misleading, as more research is needed to validate these claims. Additionally, the release lacks information on the potential cost of treatment with Ezh2 inhibitors. Overall, while the news offers hope for improved CML treatments, further clinical trials are necessary to confirm its effectiveness in human patients.","[{'subject': 'chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'predicate': 'drug used for treatment', 'object': 'drug'}, {'subject': 'chronic', 'predicate': 'subclass of', 'object': 'leukemia'}, {'subject': 'chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'predicate': 'instance of', 'object': 'cure'}]","[{'subject': 'discovery', 'predicate': 'possibility of', 'object': 'treatment for leukemia'}, {'subject': 'discovery', 'predicate': 'offers', 'object': 'possibility of treatment for leukemia'}, {'subject': 'discovery', 'predicate': 'offers', 'object': 'possibility of shorter treatment for leukemia'}, {'subject': 'discovery', 'predicate': 'offers', 'object': 'possibility of treatment for chronic myelogenous leukemia'}, {'subject': 'discovery', 'predicate': 'offers', 'object': 'possibility of shorter treatment'}, {'subject': 'discovery', 'predicate': 'offers', 'object': 'possibility of treatment for myelogenous leukemia'}, {'subject': 'discovery', 'predicate': 'possibility of', 'object': 'shorter treatment for myelogenous leukemia'}, {'subject': 'discovery', 'predicate': 'possibility of', 'object': 'shorter treatment for leukemia'}, {'subject': 'discovery', 'predicate': 'possibility of', 'object': 'treatment for myelogenous leukemia'}, {'subject': 'discovery', 'predicate': 'offers', 'object': 'possibility'}, {'subject': 'discovery', 'predicate': 'possibility of', 'object': 'treatment'}, {'subject': 'discovery', 'predicate': 'offers', 'object': 'possibility of shorter treatment for myelogenous leukemia'}, {'subject': 'discovery', 'predicate': 'possibility of', 'object': 'shorter treatment'}, {'subject': 'discovery', 'predicate': 'possibility of', 'object': 'shorter treatment for chronic leukemia'}, {'subject': 'discovery', 'predicate': 'offers', 'object': 'possibility of treatment for chronic leukemia'}, {'subject': 'discovery', 'predicate': 'offers', 'object': 'possibility of shorter treatment for chronic leukemia'}, {'subject': 'discovery', 'predicate': 'offers', 'object': 'possibility of treatment'}, {'subject': 'discovery', 'predicate': 'offers', 'object': 'possibility of shorter treatment for chronic myelogenous leukemia'}, {'subject': 'discovery', 'predicate': 'possibility of', 'object': 'shorter treatment for chronic myelogenous leukemia'}, {'subject': 'discovery', 'predicate': 'possibility of', 'object': 'treatment for chronic myelogenous leukemia'}, {'subject': 'discovery', 'predicate': 'possibility of', 'object': 'treatment for chronic leukemia'}]","[{'subject': 'discovery', 'predicate': 'of offers of for', 'object': 'possibility'}]"

This story gives readers key facts and a range of expert reactions and context about a study that re-analyzed heart disease prevention experiments and saw lower rates of cancer deaths among trial participants who had been assigned to take daily low-dose aspirin. Readers are clearly told that while this study provides new insight, there are some key questions that need to be answered before many experts would change their recommendations about aspirin. The only important shortcoming is that it reports only the relative risk reductions without also telling readers about the absolute differences in cancer death rates that the researchers observed. Cancers of all types are second only to heart disease as the cause of death in developed countries. A number of observational studies have suggested that the kind of low-dose aspirin regimen recommended for some people at risk of heart disease may also have some cancer-related benefits. This study attempts to avoid some of the inherent limitations of observational studies by using data that was collected as part of experimental trials that randomized people to take aspirin or a placebo pill. It is important that stories explain both the advantages and limitations of this kind of data analysis.",true,"""Although Aspirin is used in the treatment of cancer, it is advised to proceed with caution.""","The story provides a balanced perspective on a study that re-analyzed heart disease prevention experiments and found lower rates of cancer deaths among participants taking daily low-dose aspirin. While offering new insights, it highlights the need for further research before changing recommendations about aspirin. The study's focus on relative risk reductions without absolute differences in cancer death rates is a notable limitation. Observational studies suggest potential cancer-related benefits of low-dose aspirin, which is crucial information for readers to consider.","[{'subject': 'Aspirin', 'predicate': 'medical condition treated', 'object': 'cancer'}, {'subject': 'cancer', 'predicate': 'drug used for treatment', 'object': 'Aspirin'}, {'subject': 'Aspirin', 'predicate': 'medical condition treated', 'object': 'cancer'}, {'subject': 'Aspirin', 'predicate': 'medical condition treated', 'object': 'treatment of cancer'}, {'subject': 'treatment of cancer', 'predicate': 'drug used for treatment', 'object': 'Aspirin'}]","[{'subject': 'Aspirin', 'predicate': 'is used in', 'object': 'treatment'}, {'subject': 'Aspirin', 'predicate': 'is', 'object': 'used'}, {'subject': 'it', 'predicate': 'proceed with', 'object': 'caution'}, {'subject': 'Aspirin', 'predicate': 'is used in', 'object': 'treatment of cancer'}, {'subject': 'Aspirin', 'predicate': 'is', 'object': 'Although used in treatment'}, {'subject': 'Aspirin', 'predicate': 'is', 'object': 'Although used'}, {'subject': 'Aspirin', 'predicate': 'is', 'object': 'Although used in treatment of cancer'}]",[]
942,942,9089,Bodycad Announces First Use of Its Unicompartmental Knee System in Patients,"This news release announces the first two implantations of Bodycad’s Unicompartmental Knee System, knee replacement devices manufactured for individual patients using 3D printing technology and Bodycad’s “proprietary methods.” Despite claims throughout that the 3D printed devices result in “a better fit” and “the potential for improved clinical results,” the company offers no data or evidence and does not reference any studies measuring the effectiveness of the devices. The device has received clearance from the FDA in a letter stating the device is “substantially equivalent” to existing devices already in use. It should give readers pause that neither the news release or FDA letter indicate that any studies on patient outcomes were completed or even required. We offer a primer that describes the weak regulations governing approval of medical devices like this one. The news release neglected to mention that one of the surgeons quoted received more than $90,000 in payments from two manufacturers of joint replacement devices during 2016. Many people receiving knee replacements (or knee arthroplasty) are elderly and with our aging population, it’s expected the numbers of these procedures will keep growing. Estimates on the number of knee replacements performed each year in the US vary, but are projected to reach 3.4 million by 2030. Devices manufactured specifically for individuals to replicate their existing knee joint could potentially improve clinical outcomes but studies of this device are still needed to show its benefit.",false,"""Bodycad, the developer and manufacturer of the Unicompartmental Knee System, has announced its first use in patients.""","The announcement highlights the first two uses of Bodycad's Unicompartmental Knee System, personalized knee replacement devices created through 3D printing technology and Bodycad's unique methods.

The FDA has cleared the device as ""substantially equivalent"" to existing devices, but no information is given regarding studies on patient outcomes. It is important to note that one of the quoted surgeons received significant payments from joint replacement device manufacturers in 2016.

959,959,11128,Experimental Psoriasis Drug Bests Older Treatment,"But neither story disclosed the conflicts of interest of the principal investigator. It’s difficult sometimes for journalists to dig and find conflicts of interest in those making claims about health care interventions. But when the conflicts are disclosed and published for anyone to see, why would a news story fail to include that information in a story? And neither story discussed the costs of biolgic drugs in the treatment of psoriasis. These drugs can cost $1,500-2,000/month. We think that any discussion about a new drug should include some comment about costs. Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition that, in its more aggressive forms, can produce a good deal of discomfort and disfigurement.

975,975,10497,Are You At Risk ? 5 Different Types of Prostate Cancer Found,"This news release puts readers in a worried, defensive posture right from the get-go with its headline, “Are you at risk?” It concludes with a pitch for the services of robotic prostate cancer surgeon and urologic oncologist Dr. David Samadi of Lenox Hill Hospital in New York. In between, it briefly recaps a study published in the EBioMedicine journal that apparently discovered “five different types of prostate cancer” (the study characterizes this finding, much more soberly, as “five separate patient subgroups with distinct genomic alterations and expression profiles”). The release suggests that genetic testing used in the study is better than current methods at forecasting prostate cancer progression; however, this apparent benefit is never quantified and key limitations of the study are never addressed. The tone is promotional, with links to a Fox news program featuring the surgeon quoted, a link to a “ProstateCancer911” website and the surgeon’s phone number for making an appointment for a consult. The study seems secondary at best. About 220,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer in the United States annually, according to the American Cancer Society. The vast majority (98 percent) live at least 10 years after diagnosis and 94 percent are alive 15 years after diagnosis. If the cancer spreads to other parts of the body, the risk for death increases. This study highlights the possibility that men with high-risk gene profiles would be candidates for more aggressive follow-up treatment following removal of their prostates. The discussion also makes it clear that the value of these risk categories for clinical care remains to be determined. The news release would have done well to communicate that uncertainty more clearly.",false,"""Prostate Cancer has 5 different types, are you at risk?""","The news release discusses a study that identified five separate patient subgroups with distinct genomic alterations and expression profiles related to prostate cancer.

976,976,10798,New hope for macular degeneration,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common and potentially devastating eye disorder. There are two major types of AMD, “dry” and “wet”. “Dry” AMD is by far the more common type, but it progresses very slowly. “Wet” or neovascular AMD, is less common, but the onset is very sudden and can progress quickly to blindness. The recent FDA approval of the drug Lucentis and the publication of two studies on Lucentis in this week’s New England Journal of Medicine bring new information to patients with neovascular AMD. While the clinical trial results are promising, the extremely high cost of the drug (around $2000 a month) may be unaffordable for many patients and could place a great strain on Medicare, which would cover 80% of the cost. Furthermore, there are currently no studies showing how Lucentis compares to a very similar drug, Avastin, which is not approved for used in AMD, but is frequently used off-label for the condition and which costs much less. This story does a decent job of describing the new developments, but missed an opportunity to explain the controversy surrounding the use of Avastin. The story clearly states that Lucentis was recently approved by the FDA. The story should have been more clear that the approval was for neovascular, or “wet”, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and not the more common “dry” form of AMD. The story does states that the cost of the drug is about $2000 a month. However, the story should have provided more context by comparing this cost to the cost of other treatments for AMD. The story could have been more clear about the difference between the “wet” and “dry” forms of the disease. Although the story mentions two studies, this is not enough information on the strength of the available evidence. Specifically, there have been no studies comparing the effectiveness of Lucentis to Avastin. The story provides estimates of benefit for the drug group only. The story should have given the estimates of benefit for both the drug group and the control group. Furthermore, the story only quotes one expert.

The story mentions that fluoxetine is â€œoften used to treat anorexiaâ€, but this is an off-label use, which is not mentioned. It’s an important fact to include. The medication is more commonly prescribed for anorexic patients to treat depression and/or obsessive-compulsive disorder, common co-existing mental illnesses in these patients. The story partially describes the study design, but does not mention it was a double-blind, randomized study. The story provides absolute numbers of patients who completed the year-long study and maintained their weight. The story also appropriately notes that the difference in weight maintenance and time to relapse between the fluoxetine group and placebo group was not statistically significant.

998,998,11327,Estrogen Patch in Newly Postmenopausal Women May Reduce Alzheimer ’ s Risk,"A small pilot study has found that giving recently postmenopausal women estrogen via a patch is associated with reduced depositions of amyloid in the brain (a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease) relative to women who received estrogen orally or who took a placebo. Additionally, the study found that the association was strongest among women with a greater genetic risk of Alzheimer’s disease. The study was carefully done, and the news release offers some useful details about the study’s methods. However, the study included just 68 women, too few to make the patterns found reliable. To its credit, the release quotes the lead author about the need for larger replications. But that begs the question of why the Mayo Clinic seeks to publicize this work at all, particularly with a news release headline that emphasizes disease reduction potential, when the study only looked at amyloid levels, a risk marker. There is very active debate as to whether lowering amyloid will have any impact on actual symptoms or rates of Alzheimer’s disease. A better headline might have been: “Pilot Study Suggests Estrogen Patch in Newly Postmenopausal Women Reduces Amyloid, Marker of Alzheimer’s Risk.” Journalists certainly deserve to know about this study, but they need to keep it in their back pockets until more rigorous clinical studies have been done. Whether estrogen replacement therapy is of value to postmenopausal women is contested territory, and researchers, including those in the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study from which this research stems, are trying to explore the contingencies, if any, that distinguish women who could benefit from estrogen supplementation from those who may not. This study adds to a body of work looking at the “timing hypothesis,” that is, the notion that estrogen has different effects in the heart and brain when given to younger postmenopausal woman compared to women in their 60s or 70s. Studies of effects on the heart using intermediate disease markers (carotid artery thickness, analogous to heart disease in the way that amyloid deposition is to Alzheimer disease) in lieu of clinical outcomes (heart attacks, cognitive impairment) have been appearing in journals over the past two years. Considered in this context, the research is of interest but needs to be shared with a strong dose of qualifiers.",mixture,"""An estrogen patch may lower the risk of Alzheimer's in newly postmenopausal women.""","The study suggests that using an estrogen patch in newly postmenopausal women may lead to reduced amyloid depositions in the brain, which are linked to Alzheimer's disease.

It is important to note that while lowering amyloid levels is a promising step, the actual impact on Alzheimer's disease symptoms or rates is still a topic of debate. Researchers are exploring whether estrogen supplementation is beneficial for postmenopausal women, particularly in relation to the timing of treatment initiation. This study contributes to the ongoing investigation into the effects of estrogen on the brain and heart, highlighting the need for further rigorous clinical studies before drawing definitive conclusions.","[{'subject': 'postmenopausal', 'predicate': 'has effect', 'object': ""Alzheimer's""}, {'subject': 'estrogen patch', 'predicate': 'medical condition treated', 'object': ""Alzheimer's""}, {'subject': 'estrogen patch', 'predicate': 'facet of', 'object': 'postmenopausal'}]","[{'subject': 'estrogen patch', 'predicate': 'risk of', 'object': 'of Alzheimer in newly postmenopausal women'}, {'subject': 'estrogen patch', 'predicate': 'risk of', 'object': 'of Alzheimer in postmenopausal women'}, {'subject': 'estrogen patch', 'predicate': 'risk of', 'object': 'of Alzheimer'}, {'subject': 'of Alzheimer', 'predicate': 'is in', 'object': 'newly postmenopausal women'}, {'subject': 'estrogen patch', 'predicate': 'risk of', 'object': 'of Alzheimer in women'}]","[{'subject': 'patch', 'predicate': 'lower of in', 'object': 'risk'}]"

1012,1012,9048,Proper exercise can reverse damage from heart aging,"Getty Images This news release describes a small study (~50 subjects) from UT Southwestern Medical Center showing that fairly aggressive and regular exercise in sedentary, middle-aged individuals can marginally increase maximum oxygen uptake and moderately improve the elasticity of the main pumping chamber of the heart (left ventricle). Although the news release does a good job outlining the prescribed exercise regime, it makes unwarranted and confusing claims about reversing damage from “heart aging,” and suggesting the findings might “help prevent risk of future heart failure.” This language is not justified. The research can’t tell us if risk for heart failure has been reduced in these study participants. Nor does it establish what is meant by “heart aging” and how that has been “reversed” by the intervention. The news release would have been markedly improved if such terms had been dropped, and focused more on what is — and is not known — about poor fitness as a risk factor for heart failure. Cardiovascular health is a major health issue for middle-aged people and their health care providers. It makes research like this very interesting for readers, and we believe that places a premium on clear language. This study had little to do with “heart aging” or even heart failure. So using such language in both the news release title, as well as the opening paragraph, sets up readers to be misguided and misinformed.",mixture,"""Proper exercise has the ability to reverse the damage caused by heart aging.""","The study from UT Southwestern Medical Center suggests that regular and aggressive exercise in sedentary, middle-aged individuals can slightly increase maximum oxygen uptake and moderately improve the elasticity of the main pumping chamber of the heart.

1024,1024,10484,Doctor Challenges Cause Of MS And Treatment,"This story explores the controversy surrounding a new surgical procedure, similar to balloon angioplasty for blocked coronary arteries, that purportedly treats multiple sclerosis. The story’s emphasis on skeptical perspectives is appropriate for a treatment that hasn’t been rigorously studied and whose biological basis remains questionable. And in a story where it would have been all too easy to profile someone with a “miracle” recovery following the procedure, the writer defies convention and focuses on the disappointed patient who didn’t derive the expected benefit. For all its appropriate caution, the story lacks the exploration of evidence that we feel is the core of any good health story. It talks a lot about conflicting studies and quotes various expert opinions, but it never provides a run down of what kinds of studies have been performed and what they’ve found so far. This kind of information is critical for informed decision-making about treatments. Multiple sclerosis is a condition that rightly instills fear in patients who have been diagnosed with it. Despite this fear, for many the course of MS is slow and not associated with significant impairment. However, for some it is a relapsing and remitting condition that inexorably progresses to disability. Though there are FDA approved treatments for MS, the treatments have modest benefit and real side effects. Thus, any new treatment that offers a cure or can slow down or reverse the course would be of tremendous interest to those affected. The problem is that in the desperate search for a cure, patients, family and providers can seek out risky and expensive treatments that haven’t been adequately studied.",mixture,"""The cause and treatment of MS are being challenged by a doctor.""","The controversy surrounding a new surgical procedure for treating multiple sclerosis, similar to balloon angioplasty for blocked coronary arteries, is explored in this story.

There would certainly be less money for schools if the tax extension fails. But the advertisements say nothing about the fact that Prop 30 was a temporary measure, and that its revenue was not promised forever. Nor do they mention that school budgets will continue to go up for several years until the Prop 30 revenue runs out after 2018. Supporters of 55 point to an estimated $4 billion school funding deficit by the 2019-2020 fiscal year, if the measure fails. They also cite a separate $4 billion operating shortfall for all its services by the same year. Another respected financial outlook, however, projects a $2 billion operating surplus for California that same year. That estimate paints a very different picture.

1045,1045,9189,FDA approves new psoriasis drug,"The US Food and Drug Administration just approved a new drug to treat psoriasis, a common skin condition that can form thick, silvery scales and itchy, dry, red patches. Siliq (brodalumab) is mainly intended for patients who don’t respond to other forms of treatment, like anti-inflammatory topical medications and light therapies. The “last resort” recommendation may be due to the four completed suicides that took place during the clinical trial, leading the FDA to believe that Siliq may be correlated to an increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior — especially in patients with a history of depression. As a result, the FDA is requiring Siliq to be sold with a “boxed warning” (the strictest warning put in the labeling of prescription drugs) and only through a restricted program. The FDA news release devotes a significant chunk to the drug’s potential harms and makes clear who should or shouldn’t be taking Siliq. What’s mainly missing from the release are any numbers to give a sense of the scope of potential benefits and harms. Regarding the drug’s potential benefits, the release uses only vague, comparative wording (“more patients… had skin that was clear or almost clear.”). We don’t know how the participants were selected, how long they were followed up and how their improvement was assessed. Furthermore, a clinical trial was stopped for a period of time due to safety concerns, which was then continued by another drug manufacturer. Although not explicitly stated, it is fair to assume that drug manufacturers also funded these clinical trials. These are study limitations that were never disclosed by the news release. We did find a 90-page FDA briefing document online from 2016, which includes some efficacy data. Curiously, this document mentions five clinical trials instead of three. We’re not sure why the FDA release didn’t include the two other clinical trials that compared Siliq (brodalumab) to ustekinumab. We also reviewed TIME.com’s coverage of this new drug. Specialty drugs treating skin conditions like psoriasis can be expensive. The main competitors to Valeant’s Siliq may be Novartis’ Cosentyx and Eli Lilly’s Taltz — both of which cost at least $16,600 for one dose. Although some of this could be covered by insurance, patients could still be responsible for co-pays, which could amount to thousands of dollars. In addition, if patients have exhausted all existing treatment options and are desperate to clear up their psoriasis, they may be willing to try riskier therapies. If there is a new alternative that is FDA-approved and cost-effective, then it certainly deserves to be reported — as in this case, with strong caveats.",mixture,"""The FDA has given approval for a new drug to be used in the treatment of psoriasis.""","The FDA has approved a new drug called Siliq (brodalumab) to treat psoriasis, a common skin condition characterized by thick, silvery scales and itchy, dry, red patches.

People suffering from vertigo can have symptoms ranging from miserable to completely debilitating. And since vertigo can have various causes, treatments can vary, as can their effectiveness.

1061,1061,9156,City of Hope researcher find regular use of aspirin can lower risk of breast cancer for woman,"The release focuses on a recent paper published in the journal Breast Cancer Research, which addresses breast cancer risk and regular use of aspirin in low doses. While the release states that low doses of aspirin “reduces the risk of breast cancer in women,” there are problems with how the information is presented. Specifically, it’s impossible to know whether the aspirin affected breast cancer risk based on this study. That’s because this was an observational study — meaning that it could detect a correlation between aspirin use and breast cancer, but not whether the use of aspirin was actually responsible for lower rates of breast cancer. That’s a key distinction. Breast cancer is the second most common type of cancer among women in the United States and is diagnosed in hundreds of thousands of women each year. That means many thousands — if not millions — of women and their loved ones are on the lookout for things they can do to reduce their risk of developing breast cancer. Telling the public that aspirin reduces cancer risk has the potential to influence the daily decisions of those women, which is problematic when the relevant study is unable to make that determination. What’s more, daily aspirin use can cause or exacerbate other health problems, which this release does not address at all.",mixture,"""Research conducted at City of Hope suggests that the regular intake of aspirin may reduce the risk of breast cancer in women.""","The study mentioned in the release, published in the journal Breast Cancer Research, discusses the relationship between regular low-dose aspirin use and breast cancer risk. However, it is important to note that the study was observational, meaning it could only establish a correlation, not causation, between aspirin use and lower breast cancer rates. This distinction is crucial as it impacts the interpretation of the findings.

1078,1078,9589,Fish Oil Has Benefits After a Heart Attack : Study,"In a randomized controlled trial studying fish oil versus placebo, a very modest improvement in heart health markers was observed in people prescribed fish oil. This TIME article demonstrates a good understanding of the study’s novelty, which appears to be among the first to look at potential benefits of fish oil in patients who have just had a heart attack. However, the story missed the mark in several ways: It didn’t mention the potential harms of taking fish oil if you’re a post-heart attack patient, nor did it discuss costs of the intervention. The only person quoted is the lead researcher of the study–an independent source was needed. Lastly, several limitations of the study are not discussed, including that many patients did not return for post-treatment follow-up. Fish oil is a widely used health supplement. Notwithstanding dozens of rigorous studies that cast doubt on its actual health benefits, the popularity of fish oil supplements remains unabated. Most studies have looked at the preventive benefits of fish oil in high-risk populations. The study reported here, on the other hand, examines the protective benefits of fish oil in patients right after a heart attack. The results suggest that high doses of fish oil after a heart attack may have modest benefits, based on measurements of things like scarring and heart function, which are surrogate markers. News coverage ideally points out this fact–that these markers can’t tell us if fish oil actually reduces the risk of a repeat heart attack, death or other cardiac event.",mixture,"""A study has found that fish oil has benefits following a heart attack.""","The study on fish oil benefits after a heart attack showed a slight improvement in heart health markers for patients who took fish oil compared to a placebo.

Despite the widespread use of fish oil supplements, numerous studies have questioned their actual health benefits.

1086,1086,10229,Lung Cancer Breath ‘ Signature ’ Presents Promise for Earlier Diagnosis,"Image courtesy University of LouisvilleThis release discusses a study testing the efficacy of a test using the breath of lung cancer patients. Since patients with lung cancer are known to have specific chemicals in their breath — known as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) — which are caused by the disease, detecting them after the patients underwent surgery could indicate a recurrence of the disease. These chemicals are, in effect, markers for the presence of disease. The release notes the study showed a reduction in the amount of these compounds after patients had undergone surgical resection of the lung, but doesn’t give any numerical information about the level of reduction, other than to say it is “significant.” The release provides a nice description of costs and describes the test’s potential benefit to reduce harm from repeat CTs. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States with 224,000 new diagnoses each year and 158,000 deaths, according to the American Cancer Society. Both early detection and successful monitoring of disease recurrence might reduce those numbers considerably. Current monitoring for lung cancer recurrence after surgery is based on X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans. A breath test using chemical markers to detect recurrence could potentially be cheaper, simpler and less risky than repeat CT scans. However, it’s important to keep in mind that a positive breath test would still necessitate a follow-up CT scan and with almost every screening test, there is a risk of missed diagnosis.",mixture,"""The breath signature of lung cancer presents potential for earlier diagnosis.""","The study discussed in the release tested a breath test for lung cancer patients, aiming to detect specific chemicals in their breath called volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are associated with the disease.

This release from MD Anderson Cancer Center avoids the worst excesses and we liked much of what was written, including the description of the study design and quantification of the survival benefit. But some important omissions are evident. We can perhaps forgive the release for not including a discussion of cost. But there were other significant deficiencies, including lack of a meaningful discussion on potential harms of the treatment, no mention of the study funding source, and no disclosure that the principal investigator (quoted extensively in the release) is a consultant to the manufacturer of nivolumab. These are important elements to help readers understand the true extent of this “breakthrough.”  Although a somewhat uncommon form of cancer, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is an important topic. As is noted by the news release, a significant number of patients with the disease present with metastases making treatment difficult. Existing therapies are not ideal with only moderate improvements in survival. The demonstration of an immunotherapy for RCC that is more effective than existing treatments is encouraging. We should note that the “breakthrough designation” from the FDA  is “… intended to expedite the development and review of medicines with early signals of potential clinical benefit in serious diseases to help ensure patients have access to new therapies as soon as possible” (our emphasis added).",mixture,"""An advanced study shows that kidney cancer patients have a survival advantage when treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, a subclass of immune checkpoint.""","The study on immune checkpoint inhibitor for advanced kidney cancer patients shows a survival advantage, highlighting a more effective treatment option for renal cell carcinoma.

1105,1105,11172,Using PET Scans to Discover Early Signs of Alzheimer ’ s,"Alzheimer’s disease is a common and tragic disease. In spite of much research, there is currently little that can be done to stop or slow its progression. A hot area of research is in early detection. Two years ago, Medicare decided to cover PET scanning for diagnosing Alzheimer’s, with the hope that it could help with treatment and allow patients and their families to help with future planning. However, Medicare’s decision was very controversial and there are many issues surrounding the use of PET scanning for this conditon. This story does little to enlighten readers and is flawed in several ways. The story does not attempt to quantify the benefits of PET scanning. Most importantly, the story does not mention that even if Alzheimer’s is detected early, there is not much that can be done for it. The drug Aricept has only minor effects on the progression of the disease. Although the story mentions neurologic exams, the advantages and disadvantages of PET scanning compared to existing approaches are not described. How will the scanning fit in with current practice? These questions are not answered in the story. The story does not comment on the novelty or availability of PET scanning. Although the story hints at false alarms, this is insufficient information on the harms of scanning. How do such “false alarms” impact peoples’ lives? The story does quote two directors of major Alzheimer’s research centers. The story could have quoted other clinicians or researchers who could have provided some additional perspective. By accurately describing the prevalence of Alzheimer’s, the story avoids disease mongering.

In the study published in the medical journal JAMA Cardiology, researchers created a statistical model that estimated that about 28,000 patients per year with heart failure and a lowered ejection fraction could benefit from Entresto, a twice-daily pill approved in 2015. The model found that patients on Entresto lived a year longer, on average, than those treated with enalapril, and that the medication was “cost effective” when used with concurrent standard therapies. The release from the drugmaker, Novartis, describes their complex analysis and highlights their conclusion that the heart failure medication is cost effective. But the release does not include any discussion of the extremely high cost of the drug. An estimated 6 million people in the United States have heart failure, and about half of those with heart failure also have reduced ejection fraction, so any treatment for them matters for their individual health and for society’s costs of overall health treatment.

But the report fails to look beyond the narrow findings and answer important questions people will want to know as they [understandably] imagine how they might put these findings to practical use:  1. How much/little food did the restriction group eat? A 30 percent restriction for someone eating 2,000 calories per day is 1,400 calories; for someone eating 1,700 per day, that’s 1,190. Those are tough numbers. People would want to know that. 2. Is it clear the results were due to caloric restriction, not weight loss? This is the proverbial caveat big enough to drive a truck through, yet it was not mentioned. 3. Is it safe for older people–or anybody–to restrict calories by 30 percent?

But does one cause the other? In an attempt to answer that question, a trio of researchers introduced time into the analysis, exploring the relationship between clarity of vision at time 1 and cognitive function at time 2, and vice versa, repeatedly over an 8-year period. The study does find a relationship but, given the large number of participants in the study (more than 2500), it is a modest one. Alas, that does not deter either sources in the story or the headline writer, who opt into causal statements that are far stronger than the data warrant. Maintaining cognitive capacity is a major goal for aging individuals, so anything that contributes to that objective is worth attention. If eye health indeed proves to be a substantial contributor, that will ramp up attention to diagnostic and treatment options.

1131,1131,9921,Omega-3 Fatty Acids May Lower Breast Cancer Risk in Postmenopausal Obese Women,"This release describes the results of a study testing whether omega-3 fatty acids have a beneficial effect on reducing the risk of breast cancer in obese women by reducing the density of their breast tissue. Higher breast tissue density is recognized as a marker for increased breast cancer risk. The study involved a small group of women who received the omega-3 fatty acid, the omega-3 in tandem with a chemo-preventative drug Raloxifene, the drug alone, or no treatment at all. According to the release, at the end of two years, women considered obese (their body mass index — BMI — was greater than 29) showed a reduction in breast tissue density, which the researchers argued reduced their cancer risk. However, this is misleading. This finding is from a small subgroup of obese women within the already-small study. The main finding of the study — which is never even mentioned in the news release — is that the supplement had no impact on reducing high breast density whether taken alone or in tandem with Raloxifene. The release also omitted projected costs and harms of the prescription-only supplement used in the study. The American Cancer Society predicts that 246,660 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in women this year and that more than 40,000 women will die from this disease. Easy actions that women can take to prevent this disease, or at least reduce their risk of getting it, are of almost universal interest to the public. If it is shown that taking a readily available supplement like omega-3 fatty acids will reduce breast cancer risk in obese women, that’s information that will be of wide interest.",mixture,"""Omega-3 Fatty Acids are used in the treatment of Breast Cancer, particularly in postmenopausal obese women, potentially lowering their risk.""","The study tested whether omega-3 fatty acids could reduce breast cancer risk in obese postmenopausal women by lowering breast tissue density, a marker for increased risk.

1134,1134,9331,"Amarin fish oil capsule show dramatic benefit for cardiovascular patient , potentially upending market","A 25% reduction in cardiovascular events, including death, heart attack or stroke sounds like a big deal… and maybe it is. But this story about the results of a trial of a prescription drug derived from fish oil (brand name Vascepa) relies on a news release and company statements that don’t provide basic information about the precise number or type of cardiovascular events observed by researchers. Without absolute numbers, it is impossible to judge the importance of these results. It is also premature to claim that the results represent “heart-medicine history,” especially given that the findings haven’t been peer-reviewed and are at odds with numerous previous studies. The story takes a cheerleading tone and fails to supply key context. For example, it highlights a dramatic quote from a researcher without noting that he was paid over $120,000 by the drug company, including payments for speeches and other appearances on its behalf, in 2017. The story headline and text do make clear that only patients with cardiovascular disease and high levels of triglycerides or diabetes were in the trial, so it should be clear to readers that this drug was not shown to prevent disease in healthy people. The story does not give any details about potential harms of the drug. It reports key details of the trial, but without access to the full trial report, it is impossible to judge the quality of the evidence or its real significance. This story is based on the news release claim of a 25% reduction in the risk of major cardiovascular events. But what does that mean? It’s difficult to say, because that outcome consists of a combination of cardiovascular disease death, heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization procedures (placing a stent in a blocked artery) and hospitalization for unstable angina (chest pain). Based on what little we know, it is possible that the 25% reduction was driven mainly by a lower rate of hospitalizations for chest pain — an outcome that’s less important and also more subject to bias on the part of investigators who decide which patients get hospitalized and which ones don’t. It’s possible there was little or no reduction in deaths, heart attacks or strokes. Until the full trial results are released, we simply don’t know.",mixture,"""The fish oil capsule from Amarin demonstrates significant advantages for patients with cardiovascular conditions, possibly disrupting the market.""","The trial results of a prescription fish oil-derived drug, Vascepa, claim a 25% reduction in cardiovascular events, but without specific numbers or types of events provided, the significance of these results remains unclear.

1139,1139,9294,"Treating gum disease reduces prostate symptom , CWRU researcher find","This news release from Case Western Reserve University sets out to describe a relatively small study designed to further previous evidence for an observed link between gum disease and prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate). The study focuses on the likely common denominator of a body-wide biological process that releases inflammatory cytokines into blood and tissue, along with other possibilities; and on the clear possibility that non-surgical dental treatment will help. The study report in the journal Dentistry goes to some lengths to caution readers about the very shaky nature of this evidence and the fact that the study was not designed to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between periodontitis (the fancy name for inflammatory gum disease) and high PSA levels in the blood of men with prostatitis symptoms. The study authors also lay out several caveats and limitations of their study, including the small number of participants and lack of a control group. Alas, the release fails to exercise that same wise caution. It misleadingly refers to PSA reductions that were not statistically significant, and states flatly that “Treating gum disease reduced symptoms of prostate inflammation.” This overstates the value of the evidence presented in the study. Both periodontal disease and prostate disease (inflammation, tissue and tooth loss, and cancer) are widespread and have serious health consequences. Indeed, as the release and study point out, the suspected inflammatory process involved in both has also been linked to some forms of heart disease and autoimmune forms of arthritis. As a result, promoting dental care for gum disease as a means of reducing PSA levels and prostatitis (potential precursor signs of prostate cancer) poses a tantalizing means of controlling real health problems. Promoting evidence that supports the value of dental therapy in this context, however, should be accompanied by caution about the well-known debates over the meaning of high or low  PSA levels (especially in younger men and with only a single PSA test); and caution as well about the limitations of self-reported symptoms of prostatitis in a study with no control group. The authors of the study provide important context on these issues; we wish the news release had followed that lead.",mixture,"""Research from CWRU indicates that treating gum disease can alleviate symptoms of the prostate.""","The study from Case Western Reserve University explores the potential connection between gum disease and prostatitis, suggesting that non-surgical dental treatment may help reduce symptoms of prostate inflammation.

1144,1144,8966,Combination approach show promise for beating advanced melanoma,"This news release describes a phase 1b trial to test whether injecting an immune stimulant directly into metastatic melanoma lesions would change the environment around the tumor in ways that would make an immunotherapy drug, pembrolizumab (Keytruda), more effective. But it’s important the readers are left primarily with the understanding that the results are from the dose-escalation phase–the part of a clinical trial where the researchers look to determine the “best” dose, typically meaning the highest dose that can be used without causing adverse symptoms or side effects. The study was not designed to see whether this approach was better than the approach currently used, or if it helped some people with metastatic melanoma live longer. Yet, the headline states: Combination approach shows promise for beating advanced melanoma. The sub-headline asserts, “the new treatment is more effective in people receiving immunotherapy for the first time.” And the first paragraph asserts that “a treatment that uses a bacteria-like agent in combination with an immunotherapy drug could help some people with advanced melanoma … live longer.” None of that is known yet. It also is notable that the release made no mention of side effects among patients given this combination of therapies–even though that’s what this trial was examining. Immunotherapy has seen some of its greatest success in the treatment of metastatic melanoma. But it doesn’t work in all patients. Scientists hope by learning why it doesn’t always work they can develop new types of immunotherapies, new combinations of immunotherapies or new ways to use immunotherapy drugs that will achieve the desired response: allowing people with metastatic melanoma to live longer. This news release describes a study that included 22 people, nine of whom were receiving an immunotherapy for the first time. Seven of those nine had “a positive response” to the drug combination. In two, the tumors disappeared completely. That’s a good thing. Would the patients have had the same response if they had received Keytruda alone? Maybe. Maybe not. There’s no way to know. The study wasn’t designed to test that. But this release could easily lead to news articles that make that case.",mixture,"""The Combination approach is used as a treatment for advanced melanoma.""","The study described in the news release focused on a phase 1b trial testing the injection of an immune stimulant directly into metastatic melanoma lesions to potentially enhance the effectiveness of the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab (Keytruda).

It is important to note that the study did not compare this new approach to the standard treatment or assess its impact on overall survival in patients with metastatic melanoma. The headline and sub-headline suggesting increased efficacy and improved outcomes are premature, as the trial did not investigate these aspects. Additionally, the release did not mention any side effects associated with the combination therapy, which was a key focus of the trial.

PAP therapy is often given via CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machines, and has been a standard treatment for sleep apnea for several decades. The release does a good job describing the study itself, and how the authors broke down patients into subgroups that compared age and socio-economic status. But the release also left much to be desired: it didn’t describe the limitations of retrospective studies or adequately discuss the harms or costs of these machines, which can be prohibitively expensive for some patients. Most importantly, the news release did not do a good job of establishing the novelty of this study. While there was a large sample size and various measures of quality of life, it is still unclear how this study is new since the benefits of CPAP are already well known. Obstructive sleep apnea is a common condition in the United States (and the world). It affects about 20 million adult Americans each year, and significantly decreases quality of life due to poor sleep. Sufferers of sleep apnea report daytime symptoms as well, which can include drowsiness, moodiness, headaches, and lack of energy. However sleep apnea is also a well-studied condition, and it is already known that there are several interventions, including use of a CPAP machine, that can help improve symptoms and quality of life. It would be more newsworthy if the researchers had learned something different or new about CPAP treatment or sleep apnea, instead of re-establishing what has already been known for years. The most interesting thing from this news release was that those in lower socio-economic subgroups seemed to benefit less from PAP therapy–perhaps this is a region worth further study.",false,"""Therapy has been shown to enhance the quality of life for individuals suffering from sleep apnea, a condition that impacts their well-being.""","The study highlighted in the news release demonstrates that positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy, commonly administered through CPAP machines, enhances the quality of life for individuals with obstructive sleep apnea.

At the same time, this story could have done a better job providing details from the review and quantifying the benefits in a transparent way. We also wish it had brought in some outside perspectives, which could have offered some important insights. But let’s not lose sight of the strong points:  for the second straight day, Reuters Health (and this same reporter) led with caution while others trumpeted findings. Note how the WebMD had an early quote, “This is great news.” And the NY Times’ first sentence said it “may be the next best thing” to a cure.

The common cold is responsible for a large number of lost work days, lost school days and physician visits. Over $400 Million is spent annually in the US for over the counter remedies. Unfortunately, the common cold is also responsible for significant number of prescriptions for antibiotics despite the fact that antibiotics do not work against viral infections. The common cold can also trigger ear infections, sinusitis and worsen lung disease. The Cochrane review of published studies assessing the value of a number of different zinc products as both preventives and for treatment provides a new look at a long standing question; Do zinc salts provide any benefit in the treatment or prevention of the common cold?

Despite these gratifying trends, about 225,000 Americans will be diagnosed with lung cancer in 2010 and approximately 157,000 will die from the disease. A major factor in survival after diagnosis is early detection. Chest X-rays are not sensitive enough to pick up lung cancer in its early stages. That is why more sophisticated diagnostic testing has been sought. Spiral computerized tomography (CT) has been touted as the best way to diagnose lung cancer early and save ives.

It repeatedly mentions that the procedure is experimental, not yet available and unapproved for use in the U.S. It makes clear that VBLOC appears to be less effective than gastric bypass surgery, with possible weight loss of 20 percent at six months compared to 50 percent for bypass. But the segment could have been stronger:   It should have included at least one fully independent expert who could put the technique into perspective It should have provided more detail about the state and quality of the research upon which the promising results are based It should have emphasized the potential harms of the treatment, not the least of which is that it might not work for some people. For a treatment with a price tag of $15,000 to $20,000, that’s a significant risk. It’s worth noting that the host and reporter at the end of the piece discuss the fact that controlling physiological hunger is itself not a complete solution.

1170,1170,9449,MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY : HEARTBROKEN FAMILY AWAITS FDA DECISION ON EXPERIMENTAL DRUG,"This story focuses on a family tragedy—three young boys in a single family with a fatal genetic disorder called Duchenne muscular dystrophy—and the family’s hope that an experimental drug, which the three boys have been taking as part of a clinical trial, will receive FDA approval later this month. The story is filled with emotional freight, pitting anecdotal evidence (the mother’s reflection on her sons’ vigor, which she attributes to the drug) against systematic evidence that that finds little in the way of robust benefits. While such a story offers readers a compelling look at the sometimes anguished process of clinical research in the face of a lethal disease, it gives too short shrift to the clinical research evidence available here. On the other hand, the story did a great job explaining the costs and insurance hurdles around drugs like this, as well as the possible mechanisms behind how this drug and similar ones work. Letting the emotional intensity of anecdotal information duke it out with systematic research findings is a proven reader-grabber. But selecting this narrative route requires dedication to a story line that never lets the reader forget that good, systematic evidence is paramount. Given the vividness of anecdotal accounts, the systematic details in a story like this must be a dominant and detailed part of the story. This text would have done a better job of achieving that, and doing so convincingly, with more evidentiary detail.",true,"""A heartbroken family affected by Muscular Dystrophy is awaiting the FDA's decision on an experimental drug.""","The family is hopeful that an experimental drug, currently part of a clinical trial, will soon receive FDA approval for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a fatal genetic disorder affecting three young boys in the family.

Thus the story did not accurately report on these results and compounded this with its concluding statement. The story only listed stomach bleeding and ulcers as side effects of aspirin.

The story included multiple independent sources to provide perspective, and it included a few key details about the study. While it provided the scope of the benefit of taking fish oil, it could have gone a step further to explain if those measured benefits really mean much for children’s health. There is great interest in understanding the effects of interventions during pregnancy on the health of the offspring, but such studies are difficult to conduct, since assessing outcomes that occur years following the pregnancy can be a challenge. Although the effects of fish oil supplements on children’s growth was not the primary intention of this trial, the results do suggest that mothers who take the supplements during their last trimester have children whose body mass index and body measurements for up to six years of age are better than the children of mothers who didn’t take the supplements.

The story failed to mention that if the test were to be demonstrated to have utility for early identification of Alzheimer’s disease, its initial greatest benefit would probably come from identifying individuals who might then participate in clinical trials to develop treatments for improved management of the condition.

1205,1205,10352,"New Breast Reconstruction Technique Provides Better Outcomes , Less Discomfort for Women Recovering From Breast Cancer","It’s hard to ignore a news release that claims a reconstructive breast surgery technique is “innovative” and “has the potential to be a ‘game-changer,'” as does this one from The Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, New Jersey. The release focuses on the outcome of one 43-year-old woman who received the hospital system’s first attempt at the surgery and is quoted extensively in the release. The procedure in question is available to some women who get a mastectomy following diagnosis, yet want an implant to recreate the appearance of their breast or breasts. After the breast tissue is removed, a balloon-like sac is temporarily placed in the void left behind and gradually filled with fluid. This prepares the skin and muscles nearby for a permanent implant, which is typically inserted a couple of months later for “an excellent aesthetic outcome.” This all sounds wonderful, but our review team (which includes a breast surgeon) thought the release was nearly devoid of crucial context. It doesn’t adequately discuss costs, risks, evidence, or alternatives, and it doesn’t make clear how this procedure differs from similar, more common implant techniques. It also trumpets the outcome of one woman, whose experience with the procedure — while extremely positive — may not hold true for many women who elect to have mastectomies. At best, this release is an incomplete advertisement. Electing to have breast surgery is often an extraordinarily difficult decision: Every patient’s cancer, her risks, and her needs are different. And while it’s nice to have options for reconstructive breast surgery — a topic that’s important to women affected by breast cancer — the advantages or disadvantages of one procedure over another seems to become less clear as more techniques become available.

1212,1212,9859,Problems spur FDA caution on insulin pump,"First, let’s be clear that this is a review of an Associated Press story as shortened by the St. Paul Pioneer Press. Some of the flaws commented on were not present in the original AP story. The story was about a 10-year retrospective study of adverse events resulting from adolescent use of insulin pumps conducted by the FDA and published in the May issue of the journal Pediatrics. Insulin pumps are being used more often to deliver insulin to the body through a plastic tube with a small tip that inserts under the skin. The article provides a good description of the pumps, indicating that they are approximately the size of a cell phone and can be worn on a belt or kept in a pocket. Insulin pumps have been primarily used by adults but are now being used more often by adolescents because it allows them to lead more normal lives by eliminating the need for them to give themselves insulin injections in public. The results of adverse events reported by in the FDA study, including 13 deaths and more than 1,500 pump-related injuries over the past decade, were accurately presented. However, no denominator was given so the numbers lose context and meaning. Estimated causes of these adverse events – patient misuse, lack of education, and device malfunction – were also described. A notable omission from the story was the importance of parental supervision as three of the 13 deaths occurred when there was no adult supervision. The original AP story provided a good overall summary of the health concerns related to insulin pump use among adolescents and the need for for more study to address safety concerns. But all for the sake of cutting 290 words, the St. Paul Pioneer Press version lost:    any discussion of cost – something lacking in about 75% of all stories we review. (And at a time when the US devotes 16% of the GDP to health care spending!) the emphasis on the parental oversight issue the perspectives of two other knowledgeable sources  Yet it left in a defensive comment from the Medtronic company ""which makes the top-selling insulin pump.""

1222,1222,10772,New psoriasis drug is more effective than current treatment,"The news release announces the results of a phase II clinical trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine, which found that an experimental drug called guselkumab was more effective than a drug already on the market (called adalimumab) at controlling the symptoms of psoriasis. However, the release leaves some significant gaps, not giving readers any information about potential harms or costs associated with guselkumab. The release falls victim to the common practice of hyperbole in its headline. This was a phase II trial in a relatively small number of subjects. Suggesting that guselkumab is both more effective and less toxic than adalimumab is nothing more than speculation at this juncture. A more appropriate title would have been, “Early phase II trial suggests that new psoriasis drug may be more effective and has the potential to leave more of normal immune system intact.”  According to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, more than 5 million people in the U.S. have psoriasis. The disease can have a significant impact on quality of life, and treatment can be extraordinarily expensive, so information about new, effective treatment options is certainly worth noting. Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease that affects the skin. While psoriasis itself is not life-threatening, because it is an autoimmune disease, some pharmaceutical treatment options affect the immune system and can increase a patient’s risk of infections — and those infections may pose a significant health risk of their own. This makes it particularly important for readers to be aware of potential health risks associated with new treatment options.",false,"""The new drug for psoriasis treatment is more effective than the existing psoriasis drug.""","The experimental drug guselkumab was found to be more effective than the current treatment (adalimumab) in controlling the symptoms of psoriasis, based on the results of a phase II clinical trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
